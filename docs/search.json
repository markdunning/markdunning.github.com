During this time, I developed the beadarray Bioconductor package for the analysis of Illumina microarray data. My PhD thesis is available online, should you be interested.\nAfter my PhD, I worked as a Bioinformatics Analyst within the Bioinformatics Core; consulting on, and assisting in, the analysis on all types of high-throughput datasets. During this time I worked on studies to define subtypes of Breast and Prostate cancer and established pipelines for analysis whole-genome and exome resequencing data.\nI held the role of “Bioinformatics Training Coordinator” in the Bioinformatics Core of Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute. I organised, developed and facilitated Bioinformatics training courses to teach computational and analytical skills to wet-lab biologists.\nFrom October 2017 I established the Bioinformatics Core at The University of Sheffield.\nI have training qualifications from thecarpentries and AdvanceHE (FHEA)"
