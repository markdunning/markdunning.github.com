    "text": "Importing “raw” RNA-seq counts into R and performing quality assessment\n\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing is now established as a standard technique for many functional genomics studies; allowing the researcher to compare and contrast the transcriptomes of many individuals to obtain biological insight. A high-volume of data are generated from these experimental techniques and thus require robust and reproducible tools to be employed in the analysis.\nIn this workshop, you will be learning how to analyse RNA-seq count data, using R. This will include reading the data into R, quality control and performing differential expression analysis and gene set testing, with a focus on the well-respected DESEq2 analysis workflow. You will learn how to generate common plots for analysis and visualisation of gene expression data, such as boxplots and heatmaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will be discussing Bulk RNA-seq only, although some of the methods and techniques will be applicable to single-cell RNA-seq. I am planning some materials on single-cell RNA-seq in the future. In the meantime, the homepage for Seurat (a popular R package for single-cell analysis) has lots of useful tutorials.\n\nSeurat homepage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will go through the setup in quite a bit of detail. If you are already fairly confident with R, you can probably skim this and proceed to the start of the pre-processing section.\n\nCreate a new RStudio project that you want to work in\nCreate folders called meta_data and raw_counts\nDownload the meta data and raw counts\n\nmeta data\nraw counts\n\nPlace the sampleInfo.csv and raw_counts_matrix.tsv files into meta_data and raw_counts folders respectively\nInstall some R packages using this command\n\n\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/install_bioc_packages.R\")\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to install some R packages before you start, which I usually do this at RStudio’s console. See the below screenshot.\n\nRather than typing the location of the install script I suggest copying from here:-\n\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/install_bioc_packages.R\")\n\nIt may take a few minutes, but you will only have to do this once for a specific version of R. To check that everything worked, now copy and paste the following command. It should print messages to the screen to say that all the packages were installed\n\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/check_packages.R\")\n\nI also recommend creating a new project to work through the tutorial. You can do this via the file menu in Rstudio and it will ask you to choose a directory on your hard drive that you want the project to be located in. Briefly, using “projects” is a convenient way of keeping all the input data, R code, and outputs for a particular analysis together in the same place.\nFile -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory\n\nIn the screenshot, I am using a directory (which doesn’t exist at this point) called bulkrnaseq_tutorial in c:\\work\\personal_development. RStudio should now refresh and your working directory will be the location that you specified. Now we will use some code to download the example data. Again, I suggest you copy from below rather than typing manually.\n\n## Create two folders for the meta data and counts\ndir.create(\"meta_data\", showWarnings = FALSE)\ndir.create(\"raw_counts\",showWarnings = FALSE)\n\n\n## Download the raw data files\ndownload.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/meta_data/sampleInfo.csv\", destfile = \"meta_data/sampleInfo.csv\")\ndownload.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/raw_counts/raw_counts_matrix.tsv\", destfile = \"raw_counts/raw_counts_matrix.tsv\")\n\nHopefully your screen should look a bit like this:-\n\nFinally, create a new “Quarto Document” from the File menu\nFile -&gt; New File -&gt; Quarto Document\n\nClicking the “Create Empty Document” button on the pop-up that appears will create a blank quarto document that you can use to type the code from this tutorial, and any comments you may wish to make along the way. The Title and Author boxes can be filled with anything you like. They are used when you want to create a report document from your code. A new panel should appear in RStudio which is your bare bones analysis. The title and author lines should correspond to the text you entered (if any) when creating the document\nR code can be added to this document by clicking the “Insert Code Chunk” toolbar option\n\nThis will give you space to type or paste R code from the tutorial. In the below screenshot, R code can be entered between lines 8 and 10. Pressing ENTER between these lines will allow more code to be written. Pressing CTRL + ENTER causes the code to be run.\n\nLines outside of a code chunk can be used to write any explanations or interpretations of the plots, stats that you produce along the way.\nAt this point you are working on an untitled document that is not saved to disk. Go through the menu File -&gt; Save and choose a file name\n\n\n\nIn this short section, we will briefly describe the pre-processing of RNA-seq data which is not typically done in R. If you are only interested in using R, you may skip to the next section.\nThere are many steps involved in analysing an RNA-Seq experiment.\n\n(Workflow image from Harvard Bioinformatics Core)\nAnalysing an RNAseq experiment begins with sequencing reads. These are large (typically several Gb) that contain information on the sequences that have been generated for each biological sample; one fastq (or pair of fastqs) for each sample. Each set of four lines describe one sequence (called a “read”).\nA typical RNA-seq experiment will have 10 - 30 million reads in a fastq file, with each read about 100 bases long. e.g.\n@D0UW5ACXX120511:8:1204:6261:40047/1\nAATGTTTATGTTCTTAAATTTTAGTTGTATATGTGAATCTTTGTAGTTTTTGCTAAAATACTAAGTAATTTATATAAAAGTGAGTTAAGAGATTTTTCTGA\n+\nCCCFFFFFHHHHHJJJJJIJJJJJIJJHIIJIJIJJIJJJIJJHIIHIJJJJJJBEGIHIJICGIDICFGIJJJIIJJGJ&gt;F&gt;GAGCGEEHEHHEEFFFD&gt;\nAs the fastq files are large, we tend to analyse them using command-line software and a computing cluster. The traditional workflow for RNA-seq compares the sequences to a reference genome to see which genomic region each read matches the best.\n\nAgain, this requires more memory than a typical laptop or desktop machine so is performed on a remote computer with large memory. The resulting file is called a bam and records the best genomic match for each read. However, as we are interested in gene expression we want to relate these mappings to the positions of genes.\nA variety of different counting methods can determine how many reads overlap each known gene region. These are know as the raw counts and are the kind of data we will start with today.\n\nRecent tools for RNA-seq analysis (e.g. salmon, kallisto) do not require the time-consuming step of whole-genome alignment to be performed, and can therefore produce gene-level counts in a much faster time frame. They not require the creation of large bam files, which is useful if constrained by file space (e.g. if using Galaxy).\nMy strong recommendation would be to use the nextflow workflow system in conjunction with the nf.core pipeline to align and quantify your RNA-seq reads. My former colleague Dr. Lewis Quayle has a really good write-up of using nf.core on his pages\n\nhttps://www.lewisdoesdata.com/2024/05/01/bulk-rnaseq-end-to-end-part-1.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUnless you are doing something extremely novel and bespoke I don’t believe it would be worth writing your own pipeline for processing RNA-seq, or any other sequencing data, from scratch rather than using what is available in nf.core.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this tutorial comes from the paper, Induction of fibroblast senescence generates a non-fibrogenic myofibroblast phenotype that differentially impacts on cancer prognosis..\n\nCancer associated fibroblasts characterized by an myofibroblastic phenotype play a major role in the tumour microenvironment, being associated with poor prognosis. We found that this cell population is made in part by senescent fibroblasts in vivo. As senescent fibroblasts and myofibroblasts have been shown to share similar tumour promoting functions in vitro we compared the transcriptosomes of these two fibroblast types and performed RNA-seq of human foetal foreskin fibroblasts 2 (HFFF2) treated with 2ng/ml TGF-beta-1 to induce myofibroblast differentiation or 10Gy gamma irradiation to induce senescence. We isolated RNA 7 days upon this treatments changing the medium 3 days before the RNA extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA really useful resource for obtaining raw sequencing reads is sraexplorer. Given a GEO, ArrayExpress of SRA dataset name it will give you links to download the raw fastq files\n\nSRA Explorer\n\nAgain, Lewis’ page has some commands for downloading these data in fastq form.\n\nDownloading the example data"

One of the last topics we covered was how to add colour to a plot. This can make the plot more appealing, but also help with data interpretation. In this case, we can use different colours to indicate countries belonging to different continents. For example, we can see a cluster of Asia data points with unusually large GDP. At some point we might want to adjust the scale on the x-axis to make the trend between the two axes easier to visualise.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp,col=continent)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shape and size of points can also be mapped from the data. However, it is easy to get carried away!\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp,shape=continent,size=pop)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScales and their legends have so far been handled using ggplot2 defaults. ggplot2 offers functionality to have finer control over scales and legends using the scale methods.\nScale methods are divided into functions by combinations of\n\nthe aesthetics they control.\nthe type of data mapped to scale.\n\nscale_aesthetic_type\nTry typing in scale_ then tab to autocomplete. This will provide some examples of the scale functions available in ggplot2.\nAlthough different scale functions accept some variety in their arguments, common arguments to scale functions include -\n\nname - The axis or legend title\nlimits - Minimum and maximum of the scale\nbreaks - Label/tick positions along an axis\nlabels - Label names at each break\nvalues - the set of aesthetic values to map data values\n\nWe can choose specific colour palettes, such as those provided by the RColorBrewer package. This package is included with R (so you don’t need to install it) and provides palettes for different types of scale (sequential, diverging, qualitative).\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\ndisplay.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen creating a plot, always check that the colour scheme is appropriate for people with various forms of colour-blindness\n\n\nWhen experimenting with colour palettes and labels, it is useful to save the plot as an object. This saves quite a bit of typing! Notice how nothing get shown on the screen.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp,col=continent)) + geom_point()\n\nRunning the line of code with just p now shows the plot on the screen\n\np \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we can also make modifications to the plot with the + symbol. Here, we change the colours to those defined as Set2 in RColorBrewer.\n\n## Here we pick 6 colours from the palette\np + scale_color_manual(values=brewer.pal(6,\"Set2\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious labels can be modified using the labs function.\n\np + labs(x=\"Wealth\",y=\"Life Expectancy\",title=\"Relationship between Wealth and Life Expectancy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also modify the x- and y- limits of the plot so that any outliers are not shown. ggplot2 will give a warning that some points are excluded.\n\np + xlim(0,60000)\n\nWarning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving is supported by the ggsave function and automatically saves the last plot that was displayed in RStudio. A variety of file formats are supported (.png, .pdf, .tiff, etc) and the format used is determined from the extension given in the file argument. The height, width and resolution can also be configured. See the help on ggsave (?ggsave) for more information.\n\nggsave(file=\"my_ggplot.png\")\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nWarning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\nMost aspects of the plot can be modified from the background colour to the grid sizes and font. Several pre-defined “themes” exist and we can modify the appearance of the whole plot using a theme_.. function.\n\np + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore themes are supported by the ggthemes package. You can make your plots look like the Economist, Wall Street Journal or Excel (but please don’t do this!)\n\n## this will check if ggthemes is already installed, and will only install if it is not found\n\nif(!require(\"ggthemes\")) install.packages(\"ggthemes\")\n\nLoading required package: ggthemes\n\nlibrary(ggthemes)\np + theme_excel()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a boxplot to compare the life expectancy values of Australia and New Zealand. Use a Set2 palette from RColorBrewer to colour the boxplots and apply a “minimal” theme to the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngapminder %&gt;% \n  filter(continent == \"Oceania\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = lifeExp,fill=country)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_fill_manual(values=brewer.pal(2,\"Set2\")) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nAnother transformation that is useful in this case is to display the x-axis on a log\\(_10\\) scale. This compresses the values on the x-axis (reducing the impact of the high outliers) and makes trends easier to spot\n\np + scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt now seems that lifeExp is increasing in a roughly linear fashion with the GDP (on a log\\(_10\\) scale).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the log transformation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logarithm of 10 (log10) is the exponent to which the base 10 must be “raised” to obtain the number 10. For example, log10(10) = 1, as 10 raised to the power of 1 equals 10.\n\nlog10(10)\n\n[1] 1\n\n10^1\n\n[1] 10\n\nlog10(100)\n\n[1] 2\n\n10^2\n\n[1] 100\n\n\nThis transformation helps in simplifying visualisation involving large numbers. The range of our gdpPercap values is extremely large. summary is a quick way to get various summary statistics from our data\n\n## we will use the $ notation for now\n\nsummary(gapminder$gdpPercap)\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. \n   241.2   1202.1   3531.8   7215.3   9325.5 113523.1 \n\n\nAfter a log10 transformation the data are much more compressed.\n\nsummary(log10(gapminder$gdpPercap))\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  2.382   3.080   3.548   3.543   3.970   5.055 \n\n\nThe largest value after the log\\(_10\\) transformation is around 5\n\n10^5.055\n\n[1] 113501.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne very useful feature of ggplot2 is faceting. This allows you to produce plots for subsets and groupings in your data (aka “facets”). In the scatter plot above, it was quite difficult to determine if the relationship between gdp and life expectancy was the same for each continent. To overcome this, we would like a see a separate plot for each continent.\nIn we attempted such a task manually we might start off by plotting Africa\n\nafr_plot&lt;- gapminder %&gt;% \n  filter(continent == \"Africa\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\nafr_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the same for Americas:-\n\namr_plot &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% \n  filter(continent == \"Americas\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\namr_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point we will have to stitch the plots together (which is possible, but we will cover this later) and make sure we have equivalent scales for all plots. In this setup we are manually specifying the name of the continent, which is prone to error. Again, we could use something like a for loop to make the plots for each continent. However, we aren’t covering such techniques in these materials as dplyr and ggplot2 don’t tend to require them.\nAs we said before, dplyr, and ggplot2 are built with the analyst in mind and have many useful features for automating some common tasks. To achieve the plot we want is surprisingly simple. To “facet” our data into multiple plots we can use the facet_wrap (1 variable) or facet_grid (2 variables) functions and specify the variable(s) we split by.\n\np + facet_wrap(~continent) + scale_x_log10() + xlab(\"GDP (log10)\") + ylab(\"Life Expectancy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facet_grid function will create a grid-like plot with one variable on the x-axis and another on the y-axis.\n\np + facet_grid(continent~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous plot was a bit messy as it contained all combinations of year and continent. Let’s suppose we want our analysis to be a bit more focused and disregard countries in Oceania (as there are only 2 in our dataset) and maybe years between 1997 and 2002. However, we can only “add” more information from our plots and not take anything away. Therefore the suggested approach is to pre-filter and manipulate the data into the form you want for plotting.\nWeknow how to restrict the rows from the gapminder dataset using the filter function. Instead of filtering the data, creating a new data frame, and constructing the data frame from these new data we can use the%&gt;% operator to create the data frame “on the fly” and pass directly to ggplot. Thus we don’t have to save a new data frame or alter the original data.\n\nfilter(gapminder, continent!=\"Oceania\", year %in% c(1997,2002,2007)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp,col=continent)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(continent~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is lots more to cover on ggplot2 and quickly we can start to understand our data without too much in the way of coding. When it comes to reporting and justifying our findings we will need to produce some numerical summaries. We tackle this in the next section."

    "text": "Functions\nFunctions in R perform operations on arguments (the inputs(s) to the function). We have already used:\n\nsin(x)\n\n[1] -0.1323518\n\n\nthis returns the sine of x. In this case the function has one argument: x. Arguments are always contained in parentheses – curved brackets, () – separated by commas.\nArguments can be named or unnamed, but if they are unnamed they must be ordered (we will see later how to find the right order). The names of the arguments are determined by the author of the function and can be found in the help page for the function. When testing code, it is easier and safer to name the arguments. seq is a function for generating a numeric sequence from and to particular numbers. Type ?seq to get the help page for this function.\n\nseq(from = 3, to = 20, by = 4)\n\n[1]  3  7 11 15 19\n\nseq(3, 20, 4)\n\n[1]  3  7 11 15 19\n\n\nArguments can have default values, meaning we do not need to specify values for these in order to run the function.\nrnorm is a function that will generate a series of values from a normal distribution. In order to use the function, we need to tell R how many values we want\n\n## this will produce a random set of numbers, so everyone will get a different set of numbers\nrnorm(n=10)\n\n [1] -1.5783919 -0.8597603 -0.7625234 -0.3144891 -0.7022250 -1.5001749\n [7] -0.8008445  0.2873778 -0.7984508 -0.7810843\n\n\nThe normal distribution is defined by a mean (average) and standard deviation (spread). However, in the above example we didn’t tell R what mean and standard deviation we wanted. So how does R know what to do? All arguments to a function and their default values are listed in the help page\n(N.B sometimes help pages can describe more than one function)\n\n?rnorm\n\nIn this case, we see that the defaults for mean and standard deviation are 0 and 1. We can change the function to generate values from a distribution with a different mean and standard deviation using the mean and sd arguments. It is important that we get the spelling of these arguments exactly right, otherwise R will an error message, or (worse?) do something unexpected.\n\nrnorm(n=10, mean=2,sd=3)\n\n [1]  4.67983860  0.05072542  1.16244153  2.32318257 -0.19558848  1.14200650\n [7]  1.01752194  1.41870527  3.70055026 -1.66237082\n\nrnorm(10, 2, 3)\n\n [1]  0.28869232  1.34287174  4.92709896  1.00136484  2.40468192  0.03824525\n [7] -1.81806790  5.08470566  0.38423856 -2.83301770\n\n\nIn the examples above, seq and rnorm were both outputting a series of numbers, which is called a vector in R and is the most-fundamental data-type.\nJust as we can save single numbers as a variable, we can also save a vector. In fact a single number is still a vector.\n\nmy_seq &lt;- seq(from = 3, to = 20, by = 4)\n\nThe arithmetic operations we have seen can be applied to these vectors; exactly the same as a single number.\n\nmy_seq + 2\n\n[1]  5  9 13 17 21\n\n\n\nmy_seq * 2\n\n[1]  6 14 22 30 38\n\n\nThese so-called “vectorised operations” are a really nice feature of R and will come in useful when dealing with more complex data.\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\nWhat is the value of pi to 3 decimal places?\n\nsee the help for round ?round\n\nHow can we a create a sequence from 2 to 20 comprised of 5 equally-spaced numbers?\n\ni.e. not specifying the by argument and getting R to work-out the intervals\ncheck the help page for seq ?seq\n\nCreate a variable containing 1000 random numbers with a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of 3\n\nwhat is the maximum and minimum of these numbers?\nwhat is the average?\nHINT: see the help pages for functions min, max and mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The digits argument needs to be changed\nround(pi,digits = 3)\n\n[1] 3.142\n\n## Use the length.out argument\nseq(from = 2, to = 20, length.out = 5)\n\n[1]  2.0  6.5 11.0 15.5 20.0\n\n## Make sure you create a variable\n\nmy_numbers &lt;- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 2, sd = 3)\n\nmax(my_numbers)\n\n[1] 10.74446\n\nmin(my_numbers)\n\n[1] -7.374453\n\nmean(my_numbers)\n\n[1] 2.109637\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have only used functions that come with every version of R. To do something more specialised we will need to install some add-on packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout random numbers…\n\n\n\nSometimes we just want to create some numbers or data that we can play around with. However, most likely we will be concerned about the reproducibility of our R code. In circumstances where randomness is involved it is common to set a “seed” which ensures the same random numbers are generated each time.\n\nset.seed(123)\nrnorm(10)\n\n [1] -0.56047565 -0.23017749  1.55870831  0.07050839  0.12928774  1.71506499\n [7]  0.46091621 -1.26506123 -0.68685285 -0.44566197"

    "text": "Packages in R\nSo far we have used functions that are available with the base distribution of R; the functions you get with a clean install of R. The open-source nature of R encourages others to write their own functions for their particular data-type or analyses.\nPackages are distributed through repositories. The most-common ones are CRAN and Bioconductor. CRAN alone has many thousands of packages.\n\n\nThe meta cran website can be used to browse packages available in CRAN\nBioconductor packages can be browsed here\n\n\nCRAN and Bioconductor have some level of curation so should be the first place to look. Researchers sometimes make their packages available on github. However, there is no straightforward way of searching github for a particular package and no guarentee of quality.\nThe Packages tab in the bottom-right panel of RStudio lists all packages that you currently have installed. Clicking on a package name will show a list of functions that available once that package has been loaded.\nThere are functions for installing packages within R. If your package is part of the main CRAN repository, you can use install.packages.\nWe will be using a set of tidyverse R packages in this practical. To install them, we would do.\n\n## You should already have installed these as part of the course setup\n\ninstall.packages(\"readr\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n# to install the entire set of tidyverse packages, we can do install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). But this will take some time\n\nA package may have several dependencies; other R packages from which it uses functions or data types (re-using code from other packages is strongly-encouraged). If this is the case, the other R packages will be located and installed too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling packages can sometimes take a long time. Fortunately we will only have to do it once **as long as we stick to the same version of R.\nNote that you can install newer versions of RStudio without having to re-install R and any packages.\n\n\n\nOnce a package is installed, the library function is used to load a package and make it’s functions / data available in your current R session. You need to do this every time you load a new RStudio session. Let’s go ahead and load the readr so we can import some data.\n\n## readr is a packages to import spreadsheets into R\nlibrary(readr)"

The values in each column have to all be of the same type (i.e. all numbers or all text).\nIn Rstudio, you can view the contents of the data frame we have just created using function View().

Tab-delimited means that a “tab” (four spaces) is used to distinguish the columns in the file. Therefore R cannot tell where the columns are, and the resulting data frame has a single column. R will not automatically use the appropriate read_csv or read_delim etc function, so you need to be careful\n\n\n\nQuick sanity checks can also be performed by inspecting details in the environment tab. A useful check in RStudio is to use the head function, which prints the first 6 rows of the data frame to the screen.\n\nhead(gapminder)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have used a nice, clean, dataset as our example for the workshop.

However, I don’t think of this as cheating to have such information to hand.

This lets us have control over what is printed to the screen. Admitedly the dataset we are using here is rather small (being only six columns), but these useful functions really shine when faced with 10s or 100s of columns\n\nby name\nFirstly, we can select column by name, by adding bare column names (i.e. not requiring quote marks around the name) after the name of the data frame, separated by a , .\n\nselect(gapminder, country, continent)\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 2\n   country     continent\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 Afghanistan Asia     \n 2 Afghanistan Asia     \n 3 Afghanistan Asia     \n 4 Afghanistan Asia     \n 5 Afghanistan Asia     \n 6 Afghanistan Asia     \n 7 Afghanistan Asia     \n 8 Afghanistan Asia     \n 9 Afghanistan Asia     \n10 Afghanistan Asia     \n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\nNow lets imagine that we want to see all the columns apart from country. It would quickly become tedious, not to mention and prone to error, if we had to type every column name we wanted to keep by-hand.\nThankfully, we can also omit columns from the ouput by putting a minus (-) in front of the column name. Note that this is not the same as removing the column from the data permanently.\n\nselect(gapminder, -country)\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 5\n   continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Asia       1987    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr package has been carefully developed over the years with the needs of the data analyst in mind. Ideally we would rather be spending our time exploring and understanding data than writing reams of code. For this reason, you will often find a helpful function for a common task.\nIf you find yourself having to write lots of code to achieve a data manipulation task, the chances are the a convenient function already exists.\n\n\n\n\n\nrange of columns\nA range of columns can be selected by the : operator.\n\nselect(gapminder, lifeExp:gdpPercap)\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 3\n   lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9    41.7 16317921      649.\n10    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\n\n\nhelper functions\nThere are a number of helper functions can be employed if we are unsure about the exact name of the column.\n\nselect(gapminder, starts_with(\"co\"))\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 2\n   country     continent\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 Afghanistan Asia     \n 2 Afghanistan Asia     \n 3 Afghanistan Asia     \n 4 Afghanistan Asia     \n 5 Afghanistan Asia     \n 6 Afghanistan Asia     \n 7 Afghanistan Asia     \n 8 Afghanistan Asia     \n 9 Afghanistan Asia     \n10 Afghanistan Asia     \n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\nselect(gapminder, contains(\"life\"))\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 1\n   lifeExp\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1    28.8\n 2    30.3\n 3    32.0\n 4    34.0\n 5    36.1\n 6    38.4\n 7    39.9\n 8    40.8\n 9    41.7\n10    41.8\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n# selecting the last and penultimate columns\nselect(gapminder, last_col(1),last_col())\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 2\n        pop gdpPercap\n      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  8425333      779.\n 2  9240934      821.\n 3 10267083      853.\n 4 11537966      836.\n 5 13079460      740.\n 6 14880372      786.\n 7 12881816      978.\n 8 13867957      852.\n 9 16317921      649.\n10 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\nIt is also possible to use the column number in the selection.\n\nselect(gapminder, 4:6)\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 3\n   lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9    41.7 16317921      649.\n10    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\nThe select function can be used with just a single column name - in a similar manner to the $ operation we saw in Part 1.

    "text": "Restricting rows with filter\nSo far we have been returning all the rows in the output. We can use what we call a logical test to filter the rows in a data frame. This logical test will be applied to each row and give either a TRUE or FALSE result. When filtering, only rows with a TRUE result get returned.\nFor example we filter for rows where the lifeExp variable is less than 40. You can think of R looking at each row of the data frame in turn and deciding whether the lifeExp value in that row is less than 40. If so, that row will be shown on the screen.\n\nfilter(gapminder, lifeExp &lt; 40)\n\n# A tibble: 65 × 6\n   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Afghanistan Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Angola      Africa     1952    30.0  4232095     3521.\n 9 Angola      Africa     1957    32.0  4561361     3828.\n10 Angola      Africa     1962    34    4826015     4269.\n# ℹ 55 more rows\n\n\nTesting for equality can be done using ==.

This performs an AND test so only rows that meet both conditions are returned.\n\nfilter(gapminder, country == \"Zambia\", lifeExp &lt; 40)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 6\n# ℹ 6 variables: country &lt;chr&gt;, continent &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;, lifeExp &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   pop &lt;dbl&gt;, gdpPercap &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that filter will always output the same number of columns as the input data frame. filter never changes the columns that are displayed.

    "text": "Manipulating the values in a column / creating new columns\nAs well as selecting existing columns in the data frame, new columns can be created and existing ones manipulated using the mutate function. Typically a function or mathematical expression is applied to data in existing columns by row, and the result either stored in a new column or reassigned to an existing one. In other words, the number of values returned by the function must be the same as the number of input values. Multiple mutations can be performed in one line of code.\nHere, we create a new column of population in millions (PopInMillions) and round lifeExp to the nearest integer.\n\nmutate(gapminder, PopInMillions = pop / 1e6,\n       lifeExp = round(lifeExp))\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 7\n   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap PopInMillions\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952      29  8425333      779.          8.43\n 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957      30  9240934      821.          9.24\n 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962      32 10267083      853.         10.3 \n 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967      34 11537966      836.         11.5 \n 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972      36 13079460      740.         13.1 \n 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977      38 14880372      786.         14.9 \n 7 Afghanistan Asia       1982      40 12881816      978.         12.9 \n 8 Afghanistan Asia       1987      41 13867957      852.         13.9 \n 9 Afghanistan Asia       1992      42 16317921      649.         16.3 \n10 Afghanistan Asia       1997      42 22227415      635.         22.2 \n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething to think about\n\n\n\nIn the previous code we created a new column called PopInMillions.

The symbol %&gt;% is pronounced then. With a %&gt;% the input to a function is assumed to be the output of the previous line. All the dplyr functions that we have seen so far take a data frame as an input and return an altered data frame as an output, so are amenable to this type of programming.\nThe example we gave of filtering just the European countries and removing the continent column becomes:-\n\nfilter(gapminder, continent==\"Europe\") %&gt;% \n  select(-continent)\n\n# A tibble: 192 × 5\n   country  year lifeExp     pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Albania  1952    55.2 1282697     1601.\n 2 Albania  1957    59.3 1476505     1942.\n 3 Albania  1962    64.8 1728137     2313.\n 4 Albania  1967    66.2 1984060     2760.\n 5 Albania  1972    67.7 2263554     3313.\n 6 Albania  1977    68.9 2509048     3533.\n 7 Albania  1982    70.4 2780097     3631.\n 8 Albania  1987    72   3075321     3739.\n 9 Albania  1992    71.6 3326498     2497.\n10 Albania  1997    73.0 3428038     3193.\n# ℹ 182 more rows\n\n\nHopefully you will agree that the code is much cleaner and easier to read and write.\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\nRe-write your solution to the previous exercise, but using the %&gt;% symbol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter(gapminder, year == 2002) %&gt;% \n  arrange(continent, desc(gdpPercap)) %&gt;% \n  select(-year) %&gt;% \nwrite_csv(\"out_data/gapminder_piped_2002.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nWe will leave dplyr for the moment (although it will never be far away from us, since it is such a fundamental tool…) and start to look at making some nice graphs to understand our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCeci n’est pas une pipe\n\n\n\nThe %&gt;% operation was introduced as part of the magrittr package, which gets loaded automatically as part of dplyr.

This means you can use piping without having to load the whole of dplyr.

    "text": "Basic plot types\nA plot in ggplot2 is created with the following type of command. N.B. please dont try and run this code, it just an overall sketch of what our ggplot2 code will look like.\nggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;, mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) +  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;()\nSo we need to specify\n\nThe data to be used in graph\nMappings of data to the graph (aesthetic mapping)\nWhat type of graph we want to use (The geom to use).\n\nLets say that we want to explore the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy. We might start with the hypothesis that richer countries have higher life expectancy. A sensible choice of plot would be a scatter plot with gdp on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis.\nThe first stage is to specify our dataset using the data argument. ggplot2 is great, but not clever enough to know what kind of plot we might want. It just creates a blank canvas.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = gapminder)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the aesthetics, as a bare minimum we will map the gdpPercap and lifeExp to the x- and y-axis of the plot. Some progress is made; we at least get axes\n\nggplot(data = gapminder,aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat created the axes, but we still need to define how to display our points on the plot. As we have continuous data for both the x- and y-axis, geom_point is a good choice.\n\nggplot(data = gapminder,aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geom we use will depend on what kind of data we have (continuous, categorical etc)\n\ngeom_point() - Scatter plots\ngeom_line() - Line plots\ngeom_smooth() - Fitted line plots\ngeom_bar() - Bar plots\ngeom_boxplot() - Boxplots\ngeom_jitter() - Jitter to plots\ngeom_histogram() - Histogram plots\ngeom_density() - Density plots\ngeom_text() - Text to plots\ngeom_errorbar() - Errorbars to plots\ngeom_violin() - Violin plots\ngeom_tile() - for “heatmap”-like plots\n\nBoxplots are commonly used to visualise the distributions of continuous data. We have to use a categorical variable on the x-axis such as continent or country (not advisable in this case as there are too many different values).\nThe order of the boxes along the x-axis is dictated by the order of categories in the factor; with the default for names being alphabetical order.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y=gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram is a common method for visualising a distribution of numeric values. Your data are split into a number of bins (which can be altered in the code) across the whole data range, and the number of observations in each bin is shown on the y-axis. Thus you can see where the majority of your data points are\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap)) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor categorical data, e.g. the country of continent columns in our case, a barplot will show the number of times each category is observed. The geom_bar will do the job of counting and plotting.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x=continent)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have particular numeric values you want to display in a barplot you can use geom_col. To give an example we will first filter the data to a particular year and continent. The gdpPercap values for each country can then be plotted. In the below plot the axis labels will be messy and difficult to read. This is something that can be customised with some of the ggplot2 options we will explore later.\n\ngapminder2002 &lt;- filter(gapminder, year==2002,continent==\"Americas\")\n\n## Notice that we plot the variable we have just created and not gapminder\n## You could also do this in one step using the piping technique for earlier\n\nggplot(gapminder2002, aes(x=country,y=gdpPercap)) + geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere appropriate, we can add multiple layers of geoms to the plot. For instance, a criticism of the boxplot is that it does not show all the data. We can rectify this by overlaying the individual points. This can give a representation of how many data points there are.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y=gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the default x-coordinate is always the same for each category. Adding some random “noise” to the x-axis can help using geom_jitter.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y=gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width=0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\nThe violin plot is a popular alternative to the boxplot. Create a violin plot with geom_violin to visualise the differences in GDP between different continents.\nCreate a subset of the gapminder data frame containing just the rows for your country of birth\nHas there been an increase in life expectancy over time?\n\nvisualise the trend using a scatter plot (geom_point), line graph (geom_line) or smoothed line (geom_smooth).\n\nWhat happens when you modify the geom_boxplot example to compare the gdp distributions for different years?\n\nLook at the message ggplot2 prints above the plot and try to modify the code to give a separate boxplot for each year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_violin()\n\n## I choose United Kingdom here, but pick a different one if you like\n\nuk_data &lt;- filter(gapminder, country == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n## As a scatter plot\nggplot(uk_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()\n\n## As a line plot\nggplot(uk_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_line()\n\n## With a smoothed line\nggplot(uk_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_smooth()\n\n\n## more than one of the above\n## You can also fit a straight line (via a linear model) by changing method\n\nggplot(uk_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n## this exercise could also make use of the piping technique\n\nfilter(gapminder, country == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\n\n# this is how we might expect the code to look like\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n# The previous output hints that you might want to group by year - otherwise it thinks that year is a numerical variable\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, group=year)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n# You may sometimes see this as a possible solution which fixes the year to be a categorical variable\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we have seen already, ggplot offers an interface to create many popular plot types.

    "text": "One very useful feature of ggplot2 is faceting. This allows you to produce plots for subsets and groupings in your data (aka “facets”). In the scatter plot above, it was quite difficult to determine if the relationship between gdp and life expectancy was the same for each continent. To overcome this, we would like a see a separate plot for each continent.\nIn we attempted such a task manually we might start off by plotting Africa\n\nafr_plot&lt;- gapminder %&gt;% \n  filter(continent == \"Africa\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\nafr_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the same for Americas:-\n\namr_plot &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% \n  filter(continent == \"Americas\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\namr_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point we will have to stitch the plots together (which is possible, but we will cover this later) and make sure we have equivalent scales for all plots. In this setup we are manually specifying the name of the continent, which is prone to error. Again, we could use something like a for loop to make the plots for each continent. However, we aren’t covering such techniques in these materials as dplyr and ggplot2 don’t tend to require them.\nAs we said before, dplyr, and ggplot2 are built with the analyst in mind and have many useful features for automating some common tasks. To achieve the plot we want is surprisingly simple. To “facet” our data into multiple plots we can use the facet_wrap (1 variable) or facet_grid (2 variables) functions and specify the variable(s) we split by.\n\np + facet_wrap(~continent) + scale_x_log10() + xlab(\"GDP (log10)\") + ylab(\"Life Expectancy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facet_grid function will create a grid-like plot with one variable on the x-axis and another on the y-axis.\n\np + facet_grid(continent~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous plot was a bit messy as it contained all combinations of year and continent. Let’s suppose we want our analysis to be a bit more focused and disregard countries in Oceania (as there are only 2 in our dataset) and maybe years between 1997 and 2002. However, we can only “add” more information from our plots and not take anything away. Therefore the suggested approach is to pre-filter and manipulate the data into the form you want for plotting.\nWeknow how to restrict the rows from the gapminder dataset using the filter function. Instead of filtering the data, creating a new data frame, and constructing the data frame from these new data we can use the%&gt;% operator to create the data frame “on the fly” and pass directly to ggplot. Thus we don’t have to save a new data frame or alter the original data.\n\nfilter(gapminder, continent!=\"Oceania\", year %in% c(1997,2002,2007)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp,col=continent)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(continent~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is lots more to cover on ggplot2 and quickly we can start to understand our data without too much in the way of coding. When it comes to reporting and justifying our findings we will need to produce some numerical summaries. We tackle this in the next section."

As we know by now, the ggplot2 package allows us to map columns (variables) in our dataset to aspects of the plot.\nIn other words, we would expect to create plots by writing code such as:-\nggplot(covid, aes(x = Date, y =...)) + ...\nUnfortunately such plots are not possible with the data in it’s current format. Counts for each date are containing in a different column. What we require is a column to indicate the date, and the corresponding count in the next column.

We can see the basic structure of the data is one row for each country / region and columns for cases on each day.\n\ncovid &lt;- read_csv(\"raw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\")\n\nRows: 289 Columns: 1147\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr    (2): Province/State, Country/Region\ndbl (1145): Lat, Long, 1/22/20, 1/23/20, 1/24/20, 1/25/20, 1/26/20, 1/27/20,...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ncovid\n\n# A tibble: 289 × 1,147\n   `Province/State`  `Country/Region`   Lat   Long `1/22/20` `1/23/20` `1/24/20`\n   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 &lt;NA&gt;              Afghanistan       33.9  67.7          0         0         0\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;              Albania           41.2  20.2          0         0         0\n 3 &lt;NA&gt;              Algeria           28.0   1.66         0         0         0\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;              Andorra           42.5   1.52         0         0         0\n 5 &lt;NA&gt;              Angola           -11.2  17.9          0         0         0\n 6 &lt;NA&gt;              Antarctica       -71.9  23.3          0         0         0\n 7 &lt;NA&gt;              Antigua and Bar…  17.1 -61.8          0         0         0\n 8 &lt;NA&gt;              Argentina        -38.4 -63.6          0         0         0\n 9 &lt;NA&gt;              Armenia           40.1  45.0          0         0         0\n10 Australian Capit… Australia        -35.5 149.           0         0         0\n# ℹ 279 more rows\n# ℹ 1,140 more variables: `1/25/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1/26/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1/27/20` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `1/28/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1/29/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1/30/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1/31/20` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `2/1/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/2/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/3/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/4/20` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `2/5/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/6/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/7/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/8/20` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `2/9/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/10/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/11/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/12/20` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `2/13/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/14/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/15/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2/16/20` &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nMuch of the analysis of this dataset has looked at trends over time (e.g. increasing /decreasing case numbers, comparing trajectories). As we know by now, the ggplot2 package allows us to map columns (variables) in our dataset to aspects of the plot.\nIn other words, we would expect to create plots by writing code such as:-\nggplot(covid, aes(x = Date, y =...)) + ...\nUnfortunately such plots are not possible with the data in it’s current format. Counts for each date are containing in a different column. What we require is a column to indicate the date, and the corresponding count in the next column. Such data arrangements are known as long data; whereas we have wide data. Fortunately we can convert between the two using the tidyr package (also part of tidyverse).\n\n## install tidyr if you don't already have it\ninstall.packages(\"tidyr\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout “tidy data”\n\n\n\nFor more information on tidy data, and how to convert between long and wide data, see\nhttps://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html\n\n\nFor convenience we will also rename the column containing country names\n\n## set the show_col_types argument to FALSE to suppress message about column types\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\ncovid &lt;- read_csv(\"raw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE) %&gt;% \n    rename(country = `Country/Region`) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(5:last_col(),names_to=\"Date\", values_to=\"Cases\")\ncovid\n\n# A tibble: 330,327 × 6\n   `Province/State` country       Lat  Long Date    Cases\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/22/20     0\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/23/20     0\n 3 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/24/20     0\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/25/20     0\n 5 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/26/20     0\n 6 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/27/20     0\n 7 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/28/20     0\n 8 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/29/20     0\n 9 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/30/20     0\n10 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 1/31/20     0\n# ℹ 330,317 more rows\n\n\nThe number of rows and columns has changed dramatically, but this is a much more usable form for dplyr and ggplot2.\nAnother point to note is that the dates are not in an internationally recognised format, which could cause a problem for some visualisations that rely on date order.\n\nWe can fix by explicitly converting to YYYY-MM-DD format. The as.Date function can be used to convert an existing column into standardised dates. It needs to know how the months, days and years are being specified which might look a bit obtuse. The specification needed for these data is %m/%d/%y. This means months(%m) separated by a / followed by a day (%d) followed by another / followed by the year represented by two digits (%y). Other conversions are possible including if you have dates with month names (Jan, Feb…) or four digit years. See the link below for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDealing with dates\n\n\n\nSee this website for more about representing and converting dates in R.\n\nhttps://www.statology.org/r-date-format/\n\nFor more ways of dealing with dates in R see the lubridate package which can handle tasks such as calculating intervals between dates and much more\n\n\n\ncovid &lt;- read_csv(\"raw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE) %&gt;% \n    rename(country = `Country/Region`) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(5:last_col(),names_to=\"Date\", values_to=\"Cases\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(Date=as.Date(Date,\"%m/%d/%y\"))\ncovid\n\n# A tibble: 330,327 × 6\n   `Province/State` country       Lat  Long Date       Cases\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-22     0\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-23     0\n 3 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-24     0\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-25     0\n 5 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-26     0\n 6 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-27     0\n 7 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-28     0\n 8 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-29     0\n 9 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-30     0\n10 &lt;NA&gt;             Afghanistan  33.9  67.7 2020-01-31     0\n# ℹ 330,317 more rows\n\n\nAnother useful modification is to make sure only one row exists for each country. If we look at the data for some countries (e.g. China and UK) there are different entries for provinces and oversees territories. So we can change the Cases to be the sum of all cases for that country on a particular day. We can do this using the group_by and summarise functions from above.\n\ncovid &lt;- read_csv(\"raw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE) %&gt;% \n  rename(country = `Country/Region`) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(5:last_col(),names_to=\"Date\", values_to=\"Cases\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(Date=as.Date(Date,\"%m/%d/%y\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(country,Date) %&gt;% \n  summarise(Cases = sum(Cases))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country'.

Most of the country names that appear in gapminder also appear in the covid dataset, so not much data is lost in the join.\nSince we are interested in European countries for this dataset, we pre-filter the gapminder data.

The helper function last_col() is incredibly useful for this as we don’t need to know the name of the column. Using summarise we can add all the values in the column. This is the cumulative number of casees at the last date in the dataset. Dividing by one million (1e6) makes the numbers a bit easier to read.\n\nfilter(covid, `Country/Region` == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;% \n  select(last_col()) %&gt;% \n  summarise(sum(.) / 1e6)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(.)/1e+06`\n           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1           24.7\n\n\nFor the truncated dataset, the number of counts is substantially lower as we are missing the mainland Uk data. So it is not surprisingly that the trend lines for the Uk did not look correct.\n\nfilter(covid_bad, `Country/Region` == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;% \n  select(last_col()) %&gt;% \n  summarise(sum(.))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(.)`\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    63439\n\n\nIn this particular instance I think my poor internet connection on the train wi-fi must have caused me to not download the complete file. Since no errors were produced I might not have detected the problem if I wasn’t trying to visualise data for United Kingdom which happened to be located towards the bottom of the file.\nChecking the dimensions of the tibble help to diagnose the problem, but there are couple of other techniques. R has an in-built function to check the size of a file.\n\nfile.size(\"raw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\")\n\n[1] 1820194\n\n\n\nfile.size(\"time_series_covid19_confirmed_global_BAD.csv\")\n\n[1] 1714255\n\n\nA bit more rigourous is to calculate a checksum. In short, this is a calculated value that represents the exact contents of a file. If the file changes — even by a single byte — the checksum changes as well. That’s why it’s often described as a “digital fingerprint” for data integrity. This can be done in R by first loading the tools library and using the md5sum function.\n\n# Load the tools package\nlibrary(tools)\n\n# Compute MD5 checksum for a file\nfile_path &lt;- \"path/to/your/file.txt\"\nchecksum &lt;- md5sum(\"raw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\")\nchecksum\n\nraw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv \n               \"095dfec62d4981a32630bed5094296f7\" \n\n\n\nchecksum_bad &lt;- md5sum(\"time_series_covid19_confirmed_global_BAD.csv\")\nchecksum_bad\n\ntime_series_covid19_confirmed_global_BAD.csv \n          \"179af9d326d1c9451c49e5d9821c85e0\" \n\n\nIn practice if someone is sending data you large, especially if the file is large, they will also send a file containing checksums for you to check data integrity. The following would print TRUE if both files had exactly the same contents.\n\nchecksum == checksum_bad\n\nraw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv \n                                            FALSE"

    "text": "High-throughput sequencing is now established as a standard technique for many functional genomics studies; allowing the researcher to compare and contrast the transcriptomes of many individuals to obtain biological insight. A high-volume of data are generated from these experimental techniques and thus require robust and reproducible tools to be employed in the analysis.\nIn this workshop, you will be learning how to analyse RNA-seq count data, using R. This will include reading the data into R, quality control and performing differential expression analysis and gene set testing, with a focus on the well-respected DESEq2 analysis workflow. You will learn how to generate common plots for analysis and visualisation of gene expression data, such as boxplots and heatmaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will be discussing Bulk RNA-seq only, although some of the methods and techniques will be applicable to single-cell RNA-seq. I am planning some materials on single-cell RNA-seq in the future. In the meantime, the homepage for Seurat (a popular R package for single-cell analysis) has lots of useful tutorials.\n\nSeurat homepage"

    "text": "You will need to install some R packages before you start, which I usually do this at RStudio’s console. See the below screenshot.\n\nRather than typing the location of the install script I suggest copying from here:-\n\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/install_bioc_packages.R\")\n\nIt may take a few minutes, but you will only have to do this once for a specific version of R. To check that everything worked, now copy and paste the following command. It should print messages to the screen to say that all the packages were installed\n\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/check_packages.R\")\n\nI also recommend creating a new project to work through the tutorial. You can do this via the file menu in Rstudio and it will ask you to choose a directory on your hard drive that you want the project to be located in. Briefly, using “projects” is a convenient way of keeping all the input data, R code, and outputs for a particular analysis together in the same place.\nFile -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory\n\nIn the screenshot, I am using a directory (which doesn’t exist at this point) called bulkrnaseq_tutorial in c:\\work\\personal_development. RStudio should now refresh and your working directory will be the location that you specified. Now we will use some code to download the example data. Again, I suggest you copy from below rather than typing manually.\n\n## Create two folders for the meta data and counts\ndir.create(\"meta_data\", showWarnings = FALSE)\ndir.create(\"raw_counts\",showWarnings = FALSE)\n\n\n## Download the raw data files\ndownload.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/meta_data/sampleInfo.csv\", destfile = \"meta_data/sampleInfo.csv\")\ndownload.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/files/training/bulk_rnaseq/raw_counts/raw_counts_matrix.tsv\", destfile = \"raw_counts/raw_counts_matrix.tsv\")\n\nHopefully your screen should look a bit like this:-\n\nFinally, create a new “Quarto Document” from the File menu\nFile -&gt; New File -&gt; Quarto Document\n\nClicking the “Create Empty Document” button on the pop-up that appears will create a blank quarto document that you can use to type the code from this tutorial, and any comments you may wish to make along the way. The Title and Author boxes can be filled with anything you like. They are used when you want to create a report document from your code. A new panel should appear in RStudio which is your bare bones analysis. The title and author lines should correspond to the text you entered (if any) when creating the document\nR code can be added to this document by clicking the “Insert Code Chunk” toolbar option\n\nThis will give you space to type or paste R code from the tutorial. In the below screenshot, R code can be entered between lines 8 and 10. Pressing ENTER between these lines will allow more code to be written. Pressing CTRL + ENTER causes the code to be run.\n\nLines outside of a code chunk can be used to write any explanations or interpretations of the plots, stats that you produce along the way.\nAt this point you are working on an untitled document that is not saved to disk. Go through the menu File -&gt; Save and choose a file name"

    "text": "In this short section, we will briefly describe the pre-processing of RNA-seq data which is not typically done in R. If you are only interested in using R, you may skip to the next section.\nThere are many steps involved in analysing an RNA-Seq experiment.\n\n(Workflow image from Harvard Bioinformatics Core)\nAnalysing an RNAseq experiment begins with sequencing reads. These are large (typically several Gb) that contain information on the sequences that have been generated for each biological sample; one fastq (or pair of fastqs) for each sample. Each set of four lines describe one sequence (called a “read”).\nA typical RNA-seq experiment will have 10 - 30 million reads in a fastq file, with each read about 100 bases long. e.g.\n@D0UW5ACXX120511:8:1204:6261:40047/1\nAATGTTTATGTTCTTAAATTTTAGTTGTATATGTGAATCTTTGTAGTTTTTGCTAAAATACTAAGTAATTTATATAAAAGTGAGTTAAGAGATTTTTCTGA\n+\nCCCFFFFFHHHHHJJJJJIJJJJJIJJHIIJIJIJJIJJJIJJHIIHIJJJJJJBEGIHIJICGIDICFGIJJJIIJJGJ&gt;F&gt;GAGCGEEHEHHEEFFFD&gt;\nAs the fastq files are large, we tend to analyse them using command-line software and a computing cluster. The traditional workflow for RNA-seq compares the sequences to a reference genome to see which genomic region each read matches the best.\n\nAgain, this requires more memory than a typical laptop or desktop machine so is performed on a remote computer with large memory. The resulting file is called a bam and records the best genomic match for each read. However, as we are interested in gene expression we want to relate these mappings to the positions of genes.\nA variety of different counting methods can determine how many reads overlap each known gene region. These are know as the raw counts and are the kind of data we will start with today.\n\nRecent tools for RNA-seq analysis (e.g. salmon, kallisto) do not require the time-consuming step of whole-genome alignment to be performed, and can therefore produce gene-level counts in a much faster time frame. They not require the creation of large bam files, which is useful if constrained by file space (e.g. if using Galaxy).\nMy strong recommendation would be to use the nextflow workflow system in conjunction with the nf.core pipeline to align and quantify your RNA-seq reads. My former colleague Dr. Lewis Quayle has a really good write-up of using nf.core on his pages\n\nhttps://www.lewisdoesdata.com/2024/05/01/bulk-rnaseq-end-to-end-part-1.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUnless you are doing something extremely novel and bespoke I don’t believe it would be worth writing your own pipeline for processing RNA-seq, or any other sequencing data, from scratch rather than using what is available in nf.core."

    "section": "About “metadata”",
    "text": "About “metadata”\nModern sequencing devices are truly remarkable machines capable of taking biological material and generating vast amounts of biological sequence. However, they know nothing about the biological context of the experiment taking place - nor do they need to. If you are a researcher requesting sequencing from a Core facility you will typically submit a set of test tubes (containing prepared sequencing libraries) along with a spreadsheet giving a name to each sample. These names can be as simple as “Sample 1”, “Sample 2” etc. When the data come back from sequencing, the raw data will retain the labels “Sample 1”, “Sample 2”. We refer to metadata as the data that describes the biological and technical characteristics of the samples we have sequenced\n. Examples of variables recorded in the metadata might include.\n\ntumour / normal status\ncell line\nage\ngender\ndate of collection\nlitter\n\nWe include the sample groups that we want to compare, and any potential confounding factors that we might need to address as part of our quality assessment. The metadata is stored in a spreadsheet and typically entered by-hand. When creating such data we should be mindful of some best-practice guidelines that will make our data easier to read into R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSee here for a round-up of common errors to be avoiding when creating spreadsheets\n\nData Carpentry lesson on spreadsheet errors\n\n\n\nThe sampleInfo.csv in the meta_data folder contains basic information about the samples that we will need for the analysis today. This includes the ID for the sample ID assigned by the researcher (Run), the experimental condition (condition), shorter name for the sample (Name), the replicate number (Replicate) and whether the sample is a control or treated sample (Treated).\n\nsampleInfo &lt;- read.csv(\"meta_data/sampleInfo.csv\")\nsampleInfo\n\n          Run condition  Name Replicate Treated\n1  1_CTR_BC_2       CTR CTR_1         1       N\n2  2_TGF_BC_4       TGF TGF_1         1       Y\n3   3_IR_BC_5        IR  IR_1         1       Y\n4  4_CTR_BC_6       CTR CTR_2         2       N\n5  5_TGF_BC_7       TGF TGF_2         2       Y\n6  6_IR_BC_12        IR  IR_2         2       Y\n7 7_CTR_BC_13       ctr CTR_3         3       N\n8 8_TGF_BC_14       tgf TGF_3         3       Y\n9  9_IR_BC_15        ir  IR_3         3       Y\n\n\nIf you want to know how to create such a data frame based on the column names alone (i.e. if no csv file was provided), read the following note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferring the sample information from the count column names\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is sometimes possible to create a meta data spreadsheet if none is available. This relies on the column names of the count matrix being named in a consistent fashion. In this example we can see that the biological group (CTR, TGF or IR) is encoded in the name and the column names contain a _ character. The stringr and tidyr packages include the functionality for dealing cleaning these data.\n\nstringr reference guide\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"stringr\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyr\")\n\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n## Get the column names of counts - except the first column which is the gene name\ncols &lt;- colnames(counts)[-1]\ncols \n\n[1] \"1_CTR_BC_2\"  \"2_TGF_BC_4\"  \"3_IR_BC_5\"   \"4_CTR_BC_6\"  \"5_TGF_BC_7\" \n[6] \"6_IR_BC_12\"  \"7_CTR_BC_13\" \"8_TGF_BC_14\" \"9_IR_BC_15\" \n\n\nThe column names consists of various letters separated by a _. Some of these can be used to form the conditions and replicate information, and the separate function from tidyr is an efficient way of splitting the Run column into different components. The BC and number at the each of the name is not actually useful analysis, so we will remove in the next step. The remove = FALSE argument is used to keep the Run column in the data.\n\nmeta &lt;- data.frame(Run = cols) %&gt;% \n  separate(Run, into = c(\"Sample Number\", \"condition\", \"BC\", \"X\"),remove = FALSE)\nmeta\n\n          Run Sample Number condition BC  X\n1  1_CTR_BC_2             1       CTR BC  2\n2  2_TGF_BC_4             2       TGF BC  4\n3   3_IR_BC_5             3        IR BC  5\n4  4_CTR_BC_6             4       CTR BC  6\n5  5_TGF_BC_7             5       TGF BC  7\n6  6_IR_BC_12             6        IR BC 12\n7 7_CTR_BC_13             7       CTR BC 13\n8 8_TGF_BC_14             8       TGF BC 14\n9  9_IR_BC_15             9        IR BC 15\n\n\nNow we keep the columns we need, and add the replicate numbers using the rep function to repeat a sequence 1,2,3 three times. The shorter name is formed by pasting the condition and replicate number (using paste with a _ separator. Finally, Treated column is formed using an ifelse statement. This is used to test if a particular value of condition is equal to CTR or not. If it is, a value of N is used in the new Treated column. If not, the value of Y is used instead.\n\nmeta &lt;- select(meta, Run, condition) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Replicate = rep(c(1,2,3), 3)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Name = paste(condition, Replicate, sep = \"_\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Treated = ifelse(condition == \"CTR\", \"N\", \"Y\"))\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we can use basic R commands to read the counts and sample information into R, it is much more common to use specialist software for further analysis. Packages such as DESeq2 (used in this tutorial), edgeR and limma have evolved other many years to offer an efficient way of storing and manipulating complex datasets.\n\nlibrary(DESeq2)\n\nThe DESeq2 allows data to be imported from various formats, and the option we will be using here is that of a counts matrix. The “vignette” for DESeq2 is incredibly detailed, and offers code for importing data produced by different software\n\nDESeq2 Guide\n\nHowever, as we said the count matrix is the most common. It is important to note, as described in the vignette, that your counts must be raw and not subjected to any kind of normalisation or calibration. These steps are included in the standard workflow as we will see.\nThe code to import our data as given below. We also have to specify at this point a design for analysis. In the simplest terms this is essentially telling DESeq2 which column in our dataset to use when making comparisons between groups. DESeq2 will not actually do any differential expression unless we tell it to, so this is just a placeholder value for now. We can also introduce more complicated designs that might more than one column.\nWe would normally think of a “count matrix” as containing just numeric data. Our counts contains gene identifiers which might usually be a problem but DESeq2 is still able to import the data if we set tidy=TRUE.\n\ndds &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, \n                                  colData = sampleInfo, \n                                  design = ~condition, tidy = TRUE)\n\nWarning in DESeqDataSet(se, design = design, ignoreRank): some variables in\ndesign formula are characters, converting to factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning about “converting to factors”\n\n\n\nYou will probably get a Warning message including the phrase some variables in design formula are characters, converting to factors.

Low total number of counts could be indicative of poor quality sample.\nThe counts themselves are accessed using the counts function; giving a matrix of counts.

Applying the boxplot function to the raw counts from our dataset reveals something about the nature of the data; the distributions are dominated by a few genes with very large counts. We are using the base boxplot function here for convenience because the count data are not in the long data format required by ggplot2.\n\nboxplot(counts(dds))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the vst or rlog function from DESeq2to compensate for the effect of different library sizes and put the data on the log\\(_2\\) scale. The effect is to remove the dependence of the variance on the mean, particularly the high variance of the logarithm of count data when the mean is low. For more details see the DESeq2 vignette\n\n# Get log2 counts\nvsd &lt;- vst(dds)\n# Check distributions of samples using boxplots\nboxplot(assay(vsd), xlab=\"\", ylab=\"Log2 counts per million\",las=2,main=\"Normalised Distributions\")\n\nabline(h=median(assay(vsd)), col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that using vst has made the distributions more comparable, and indeed these transformed data will form the basis for most of our quality assessment. They are not however used for any differential analysis. DESeq2 has it’s own normalisation method"

A PCA is an example of an unsupervised analysis, where we don’t need to specify the groups. Each point in the plot is a biological sample in your dataset, and crucially the points can be coloured and labeled according to your metadata. If your experiment is well-controlled and has worked well, what we hope to see is that the greatest sources of variation in the data correspond to the treatments/groups we are interested in. In other words, the points on the plot should separate according to biological conditions.\nIt is also an incredibly useful tool for quality control and checking for outliers, and DESeq2 has a convenient plotPCA function for making the PCA plot, which makes use of the ggplot2 graphics package.\n\nplotPCA(vsd,intgroup=\"Treated\")\n\nusing ntop=500 top features by variance\n\n\nWarning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.\nℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.\nℹ See also `vignette(\"ggplot2-in-packages\")` for more information.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the DESeq2 package.\n  Please report the issue to the authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also an option to return the values used in the plot for further exploration and customisation.

An interpretation of this plot would be that samples separate cleanly based on Treated on the y-axis (PC2), with the non-treated samples (coloured red) having y coordinates around 10 and treated samples (coloured blue) having y coordinate around -5.\nHowever, the PCA method definition means that main source of variance cannot be explained by the Treated variable. Along the x-axis (PC1) we see three distinct groups. You would hope that these correspond to the condition, and we will assess this in the following exercise."

Although it is tempting, we shouldn’t blindly correct errors in our meta data based on what we see on a PCA. Some detective work is required to make sure that the sample labeling is truly a mistake.

However, it is a descriptive technique, not an inferential one. In other words, it cannot actually be used to prove anything about your data such as a biological hypothesis.

This means for a given GEO ID we know what files to expect, which will be helpful to organise our files in a way that Seurat expects.\n\nlist.files(pattern = \"GSM7192449\")\n\n[1] \"GSM7192449_aligned_fiducials.jpg.gz\"    \n[2] \"GSM7192449_detected_tissue_image.jpg.gz\"\n[3] \"GSM7192449_hot.h5\"                      \n[4] \"GSM7192449_scalefactors_json.json.gz\"   \n[5] \"GSM7192449_tissue_hires_image.png.gz\"   \n[6] \"GSM7192449_tissue_lowres_image.png.gz\"  \n[7] \"GSM7192449_tissue_positions_list.csv.gz\"\n\n\n\nlist.files(pattern = \"GSM7192450\")\n\n[1] \"GSM7192450_aligned_fiducials.jpg.gz\"    \n[2] \"GSM7192450_cold.h5\"                     \n[3] \"GSM7192450_detected_tissue_image.jpg.gz\"\n[4] \"GSM7192450_scalefactors_json.json.gz\"   \n[5] \"GSM7192450_tissue_hires_image.png.gz\"   \n[6] \"GSM7192450_tissue_lowres_image.png.gz\"  \n[7] \"GSM7192450_tissue_positions_list.csv.gz\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOur eventual goal is to use a function called Load10X_Spatial in the Seurat package, which data to be organised and named in a very specific manner. For a sample called Sample_1 it should look like this:-\nSample_1\n├── filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5/ \n└── spatial/                   \n    ├── tissue_hires_image.png\n    ├── tissue_lowres_image.png\n    ├── scalefactors_json.json\n    └── tissue_positions_list.csv\n    └── ... + other images files if required\n    \n\nIn other words, we need to create a separate folder for each of the four samples named according to the sample name. The “h5” file should be placed here and all other image data should be in a folder named spatial. As the IDs created by GEO are completely arbitrary and not related to the underlying question we will rename to some relating to the sample groups. This labels for this are found in the title column of the meta data."

    "text": "Why are some adjusted p-values “NA”?\nDESeq2 has already done some processing on the results to exclude genes with low expression level across the dataset that it deems to be unreliable and unlikely to be differential-expressed. The genes it filters out (those that have NA adjusted p-value) tend to have a lower value of baseMean.\n\nresults_annotated %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = is.na(padj), y = baseMean)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_y_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core principle is that genes with very low expression (low average normalized counts) have little power to be called differentially expressed, even if their true \\(\\log_2\\) fold change is comparatively large. By testing all genes, you incur a multiple testing penalty for these low-power genes, which reduces the number of genes that can be called significant overall.\nThe procedure first uses the mean of normalized counts (baseMean) across all samples as a filtering mechanism. Genes with very low expression have high \\(p\\)-values due to low statistical power (high variance relative to the mean), regardless of their true fold change. DESeq2 determines an optimal cutoff for the baseMean that maximizes the number of genes called significant (padj &lt; \\(\\alpha\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is usually \\(0.1\\) or \\(0.05\\)). This is done by testing a range of cutoffs and picking the one that yields the largest number of discoveries. Genes with mean counts below this optimal cutoff are removed (in practice their padj is set to NA). The remaining genes are then subjected to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.The benefit is a gain in statistical power. By reducing the total number of hypotheses tested, the multiple testing penalty is less severe, allowing more true positives (expressed genes with actual differential expression) to pass the adjusted \\(p\\)-value threshold.\nThe effect of filtering can be seen in the following histogram:-\n\nmutate(results_annotated, Filtered = is.na(padj)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = pvalue, fill = Filtered)) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe filtered group (in blue) represents the low-count genes that were removed. The distribution is often nearly uniform or even shows a slight peak towards the lower \\(p\\)-values. If these low-power genes were included, the overall flat null distribution needed for accurate FDR control would be slightly inflated near zero, leading to a harsher multiple testing penalty.\nNon-Filtered Group (e.g., shown in red): This histogram represents the genes with sufficient expression to be tested. This is the set of \\(p\\)-values actually used for the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment. This distribution should show a clear, desirable pattern: a strong peak near \\(p=0\\) (the true differentially expressed genes) and a flat, uniform distribution from \\(\\sim0.05\\) to \\(1\\) (the true null hypotheses).Conclusion: By removing the “Filtered” genes, the adjusted \\(p\\)-values (\\(\\text{padj}\\)) are calculated only on the well-behaved “Non-Filtered” set, resulting in more significant calls for the well-expressed genes.\nIf the details above seem complex, remember that DESeq2 will do these automatically without you having to think about them. If we think this behaviour isn’t desirable, or are curious to see the results without any adjustment, we can set the argument independentFiltering = FALSE in the results function."

    "text": "Shrinking the log fold-changes\nDESeq2 provides an estimate, for each gene, of the difference in mean expression between our groups. However, in the same way that the raw pvalues can be improved by the adjustment described about, we can also get better estimates of the log fold-changes (LFC).\nWhen we made the MA-plot in the previous section we saw a fanning effect at lower expression levels. Creates much cleaner, less noisy MA plots and heatmaps. A technique called “shrinkage” helps to address this as the “shrunken” log fold-change is a better measure of biological magnitude for ranking genes\nLog fold-change shrinkage, implemented in DESeq2 via the lfcShrink() function, uses a statistical technique called Bayesian shrinkage (or an Empirical Bayes approach) to address this.\nIt works by:\n\n“Borrowing” Information: It assumes that most genes are not differentially expressed (i.e., most true LFCs are near zero).\n“Shrinking”: For genes with low counts (low confidence in the LFC), it shrinks their estimated LFC closer to zero.\nLeaving Alone: For genes with high counts (high confidence in the LFC), the shrinkage effect is minimal, leaving the raw LFC largely untouched.\n\nTo use lfcShrink we have to supply the initial run of the DESeq pipeline (saved as de_condition in our case) and pay careful attention to the number of the coefficient that we want to apply shrinkage to.

The FoldEnrichment indicates how many more times each pathway is represented than you would expect. Somewhat reassuringly the Extracellular Matrix pathway is found amongst these most significant pathways. A dot plot can show us the most enriched pathways, their statistical significance and the size of each.\n\ndotplot(enrich_go,showCategory=20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might notice that the names of some pathways, and the numbers of genes they contain are extremely similar. For example extracellular matrix organization and extracellular structure organization. This is because Gene Ontologies are not mutually exclusive and can comprise the same genes. The results can therefore give a false impression of how many biological functions are being represented amongst the results. Overlaps between gene sets can also be visualised using an “Upset plot” - an alternative to a venn diagram. The connected dots in the bottom panel show genes that are shared between different pathways, and the number of these genes is displayed in the bar chart.\n\nenrichplot::upsetplot(enrich_go)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe emapplot function is another way of identifying redundancy and clustering the enrichment results into broader biological themes. For instance, terms like “cell proliferation,” “cell division,” and “mitotic nuclear division” would all cluster together, indicating they represent the single, large theme of “cell cycle.”\nEach node in this plot represents a significantly enriched pathway or GO term. Whereas an edge (line) connects two nodes if their underlying gene sets overlap significantly (i.e., they share many common genes).\n\nenrich_go &lt;- enrichplot::pairwise_termsim(enrich_go)\nemapplot(enrich_go)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas a gene-concept network plot (cnetplot) depicts the linkages of genes and biological concepts (e.g. GO terms or KEGG pathways) as a network. This plot can identify the core “hub” genes (genes with high connectivity) that are common to multiple enriched pathways. These hub genes are often considered the most critical players driving the observed biological change.\n\ncnetplot(enrich_go)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheheatplot is another way of visualising pathway overlaps. In this plot, each column is a gene and a black box indicating if that gene features in a given pathway.\n\nheatplot(enrich_go, showCategory = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the treeplot function performs hierarchical clustering of enriched terms. It relies on the pairwise similarities of the enriched terms calculated by the pairwise_termsim() function, which by default usese the Jaccard’s similarity index (JC).\n\nenrich_go &lt;- enrichplot::pairwise_termsim(enrich_go)\nenrichplot::treeplot(enrich_go)"

    "text": "Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)\nAn appealing feature of the GSEA method is that it does not require us to impose arbitrary cut-offs on the dataset to decide what is differentially-expressed or not. Instead it takes a set of ranked statistics for all genes and looks for sets of genes that occur either at the top or bottom of the list. As GSEA uses the direction of a test result (either up- or down-regulated) the test statistics themselves must have a positive or negative sign. Although the p-values cannot therefore be used for this purpose, they can be transformed using the same equation used in the volcano plot (-10 x log\\(_{10}\\)) and multiplying by the “sign” of the LFC (i.e. +1 or -1).\nThe steps in producing the input required for GSEA are i) calculating and retrieving the ranking statistics ii) naming each one according to a chosen identifier (ENSEMBL or ENTREZID for example).

It starts at zero and increases every time a gene belonging to the pathway is encountered in the ranked list, whereas it slightly decreases when a gene not in the pathway is encountered. The peak of this curve is the maximum Enrichment Score (\\(\\text{ES}\\)). If the peak is on the left (positive), the pathway is up-regulated; if the peak is on the right (negative), the pathway is down-regulated. + \\(\\text{GSEA}\\) Barcode (The Ticks): The black vertical lines beneath the curve are the barcode. Each line represents a single gene from the pathway, placed at its exact rank position. The clustering of these ticks—either on the far left or far right—provides the visual evidence for the calculated \\(\\text{ES}\\).\n\nThe Bottom Panel: Gene Ranking Metric displays the value of the statistic used to rank all genes.\n\nRanking Metric: This usually shows the \\(\\text{Log}_2 \\text{Fold Change}\\) (\\(\\text{LFC}\\)), \\(t\\)-statistic, or another metric for every gene in the experiment.\nInterpretation: This confirms that the genes on the far left of the plot have the most positive values (high \\(\\text{LFC}\\)) and those on the far right have the most negative values (low \\(\\text{LFC}\\)), providing context for the directional enrichment observed in the top panel.The plot therefore provides a concise, integrated view, confirming both statistical significance (from the \\(\\text{NES}\\) not shown on the curve but derived from it) and the directionality and magnitude of the pathway’s regulation."

    "text": "Which database to use?\nWe have looked the two main types of test supported by clusterProfiler using a database of Gene Ontology (GO) terms as a reference. These were implemented in the enrichGO and gseGO functions respectively. The above exercise used KEGG instead. A nice feature of clusterProfiler is that you can test different databases for significant pathways with few changes to your code. Some of the different databases and the corresponding function to use are summarised below\n\nSummary of different databases that clusterProfiler can use\n\n\nDatabase\nFunction\nPrimary Focus\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nGene Ontology (GO)\n\n`enrichGO`\n`gseGO`\n\nBiological Process (BP), Molecular Function (MF), Cellular Component (CC)\n\nBroadest Coverage: Covers nearly all known genes in most species.\nHierarchical: Allows for semantic similarity grouping (simplify()).\n\n\nHigh Redundancy: Similar terms often overlap significantly.\nFunctional Ambiguity: Terms can be very broad.\n\n\n\nKEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)\n\n`enrichKEGG`\n`gseKEGG`\n\nMetabolic & Regulatory Pathways\n\nVisual Maps: Provides detailed, manually drawn pathway diagrams.\nFocus on Mechanism: Excellent for examining core signaling and metabolic processes\n\n\nLimited Coverage: Focused primarily on well-studied pathways.\nLicensing/Updates: Access can be restricted/less frequently updated in free versions.\n\n\n\nReactome\n\nenrichPathway\n`gsePathway`\n\nMolecular Events & Reactions\n\nMechanistic Detail: Highly curated, evidence-based sequence of molecular events (reactions)\nNon-Redundant Structure: Less overlap between main pathways than in GO.\n\n\nBias toward Human: Predominantly focused on human biology.\nPathway Fragmentation: High detail can make pathways appear fragmented.\n\n\n\nWikiPathways\n\nenrichWP\ngseWP\n\nCommunity-Driven, Open Content\n\nFlexible & Collaborative: Allows any researcher to create, edit, and contribute.\nRapid Inclusion: Quickly integrates novel and species-specific pathways.\n\n\nVariable Quality: Quality control is less stringent than curated databases.\nInconsistent Scope: Pathway scale and definition can be less uniform.\n\n\n\nDisease Ontology\n\nenrichDO\ngseDO\n\nStructured Vocabulary for Human Diseases\n\nHierarchical Structure: DAG allows for GSEA and semantic clustering.\nStandardized: Provides a single, clear terminology for classifying diseases.\n\n\nGene Association Reliability: Associations are aggregated from multiple sources, meaning reliability can vary.\nRedundancy: Hierarchical terms mean high-level parent terms can obscure specific results.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, you will have to decide which database(s) are more appropriate for the interpretation of your results\n\nAdditional visualistion of KEGG pathways\nThe special feature of a KEGG pathway is its standardized, structured graphical representation as a set of computable maps. This makes that visualisation with tools like pathview is possible. The standardization means KEGG is more than just a list of genes — it’s an integrated system where both the visual elements and the underlying molecular data are tightly linked.\nIn the below we take a pathway such as “Lysosome”, use it’s standard KEGG layout and colour the genes involved in the pathway according to the LFC.\n\nlibrary(pathview)\n\n# The KEGG ID you want to visualize\nkegg_id &lt;- \"hsa04142\"\n\n# Organism code (hsa for human)\norganism_code &lt;- \"hsa\"\n\nlfc_values &lt;- pull(results_final, \"log2FoldChange\")\nnames(lfc_values) &lt;- pull(results_final, \"ENTREZID\")\n\npathview(\n  gene.data = lfc_values,\n  pathway.id = \"hsa04142\",\n  species = \"hsa\",\n  low = \"blue\",\n  mid = \"gray\",\n  high = \"red\",\n  kegg.native = TRUE,\n  out.suffix = \"lysosome_blue_red\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nPathways analysis for non-human organisms"
