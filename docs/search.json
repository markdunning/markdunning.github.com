I specialise in the visualisation and interpretation of complex data and have a wealth of experience in making results accessible and easy to interrogate for wet-lab biologists. I also have experience in developing and delivering training courses and workships, along with formal teaching.\nI obtained my PhD in the Statistics and Computational Biology group of Simon Tavaré at the University of Cambridge / Cancer Research Uk. During this time, I developed the beadarray Bioconductor package for the analysis of Illumina microarray data. My PhD thesis is available online, should you be interested.\nAfter my PhD, I worked as a Bioinformatics Analyst within the Bioinformatics Core; consulting on, and assisting in, the analysis on all types of high-throughput datasets. During this time I worked on studies to define subtypes of Breast and Prostate cancer and established pipelines for the analysis of whole-genome and exome resequencing data.\nI held the role of “Bioinformatics Training Coordinator” in the Bioinformatics Core of Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute. I organised, developed and facilitated Bioinformatics training courses to teach computational and analytical skills to wet-lab biologists - along with a series of “Bioinformatics Summer Schools” for Cancer Research funded staff nationwide.\nFrom October 2017 I established the Bioinformatics Core at The University of Sheffield which ran until August 2025. Along with supporting clinicians and researchers across campus, I also contributed to various MSC and undergraduate programs as well as obtaining training / teaching qualifications from thecarpentries and AdvanceHE (FHEA)"

    "text": "Functions\nFunctions in R perform operations on arguments (the inputs(s) to the function). We have already used:\n\nsin(x)\n\n[1] -0.1323518\n\n\nthis returns the sine of x. In this case the function has one argument: x. Arguments are always contained in parentheses – curved brackets, () – separated by commas.\nArguments can be named or unnamed, but if they are unnamed they must be ordered (we will see later how to find the right order). The names of the arguments are determined by the author of the function and can be found in the help page for the function. When testing code, it is easier and safer to name the arguments. seq is a function for generating a numeric sequence from and to particular numbers. Type ?seq to get the help page for this function.\n\nseq(from = 3, to = 20, by = 4)\n\n[1]  3  7 11 15 19\n\nseq(3, 20, 4)\n\n[1]  3  7 11 15 19\n\n\nArguments can have default values, meaning we do not need to specify values for these in order to run the function.\nrnorm is a function that will generate a series of values from a normal distribution. In order to use the function, we need to tell R how many values we want\n\n## this will produce a random set of numbers, so everyone will get a different set of numbers\nrnorm(n=10)\n\n [1] -0.6810711  0.4260667  1.7392298 -0.9309962  0.2588760  0.6624768\n [7] -0.2175299  0.3225311 -1.0049098  0.1479833\n\n\nThe normal distribution is defined by a mean (average) and standard deviation (spread). However, in the above example we didn’t tell R what mean and standard deviation we wanted. So how does R know what to do? All arguments to a function and their default values are listed in the help page\n(N.B sometimes help pages can describe more than one function)\n\n?rnorm\n\nIn this case, we see that the defaults for mean and standard deviation are 0 and 1. We can change the function to generate values from a distribution with a different mean and standard deviation using the mean and sd arguments. It is important that we get the spelling of these arguments exactly right, otherwise R will an error message, or (worse?) do something unexpected.\n\nrnorm(n=10, mean=2,sd=3)\n\n [1]  2.857028098  0.943095548 -0.755982527  4.979057859  0.016365279\n [6]  6.538872486  0.005534581  0.869902919  4.415095832  2.029449998\n\nrnorm(10, 2, 3)\n\n [1]  4.9235954  1.4908304  4.3804156  7.4590927  1.3395246  1.4895211\n [7]  2.3824205 -1.7516956  1.7891827  0.6307512\n\n\nIn the examples above, seq and rnorm were both outputting a series of numbers, which is called a vector in R and is the most-fundamental data-type.\nJust as we can save single numbers as a variable, we can also save a vector. In fact a single number is still a vector.\n\nmy_seq &lt;- seq(from = 3, to = 20, by = 4)\n\nThe arithmetic operations we have seen can be applied to these vectors; exactly the same as a single number.\n\nmy_seq + 2\n\n[1]  5  9 13 17 21\n\n\n\nmy_seq * 2\n\n[1]  6 14 22 30 38\n\n\nThese so-called “vectorised operations” are a really nice feature of R and will come in useful when dealing with more complex data.\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\nWhat is the value of pi to 3 decimal places?\n\nsee the help for round ?round\n\nHow can we a create a sequence from 2 to 20 comprised of 5 equally-spaced numbers?\n\ni.e. not specifying the by argument and getting R to work-out the intervals\ncheck the help page for seq ?seq\n\nCreate a variable containing 1000 random numbers with a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of 3\n\nwhat is the maximum and minimum of these numbers?\nwhat is the average?\nHINT: see the help pages for functions min, max and mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The digits argument needs to be changed\nround(pi,digits = 3)\n\n[1] 3.142\n\n## Use the length.out argument\nseq(from = 2, to = 20, length.out = 5)\n\n[1]  2.0  6.5 11.0 15.5 20.0\n\n## Make sure you create a variable\n\nmy_numbers &lt;- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 2, sd = 3)\n\nmax(my_numbers)\n\n[1] 11.83916\n\nmin(my_numbers)\n\n[1] -6.247082\n\nmean(my_numbers)\n\n[1] 2.231517\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have only used functions that come with every version of R. To do something more specialised we will need to install some add-on packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout random numbers…\n\n\n\nSometimes we just want to create some numbers or data that we can play around with. However, most likely we will be concerned about the reproducibility of our R code. In circumstances where randomness is involved it is common to set a “seed” which ensures the same random numbers are generated each time.\n\nset.seed(123)\nrnorm(10)\n\n [1] -0.56047565 -0.23017749  1.55870831  0.07050839  0.12928774  1.71506499\n [7]  0.46091621 -1.26506123 -0.68685285 -0.44566197"

    "text": "Packages in R\nSo far we have used functions that are available with the base distribution of R; the functions you get with a clean install of R. The open-source nature of R encourages others to write their own functions for their particular data-type or analyses.\nPackages are distributed through repositories. The most-common ones are CRAN and Bioconductor. CRAN alone has many thousands of packages.\n\n\nThe meta cran website can be used to browse packages available in CRAN\nBioconductor packages can be browsed here\n\n\nCRAN and Bioconductor have some level of curation so should be the first place to look. Researchers sometimes make their packages available on github. However, there is no straightforward way of searching github for a particular package and no guarentee of quality.\nThe Packages tab in the bottom-right panel of RStudio lists all packages that you currently have installed. Clicking on a package name will show a list of functions that available once that package has been loaded.\nThere are functions for installing packages within R. If your package is part of the main CRAN repository, you can use install.packages.\nWe will be using a set of tidyverse R packages in this practical. To install them, we would do.\n\n## You should already have installed these as part of the course setup\n\ninstall.packages(\"readr\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n# to install the entire set of tidyverse packages, we can do install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). But this will take some time\n\nA package may have several dependencies; other R packages from which it uses functions or data types (re-using code from other packages is strongly-encouraged). If this is the case, the other R packages will be located and installed too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling packages can sometimes take a long time. Fortunately we will only have to do it once **as long as we stick to the same version of R.\nNote that you can install newer versions of RStudio without having to re-install R and any packages.\n\n\n\nOnce a package is installed, the library function is used to load a package and make it’s functions / data available in your current R session. You need to do this every time you load a new RStudio session. Let’s go ahead and load the readr so we can import some data.\n\n## readr is a packages to import spreadsheets into R\nlibrary(readr)"

The values in each column have to all be of the same type (i.e. all numbers or all text).\nIn Rstudio, you can view the contents of the data frame we have just created using function View().

    "section": "Manipulating Columns",
    "text": "Manipulating Columns\nWe are going to use functions from the dplyr package to manipulate the data frame we have just created. It is perfectly possible to work with data frames using the functions provided as part of “base R”. However, many find it easy to read and write code using dplyr.\nThere are many more functions available in dplyr than we will cover today. An overview of all functions is given in a cheatsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp with dplyr functions\n\n\n\n\ndplyr cheatsheet. The “cheatsheet” is also available through the RStudio Help menu. However, I don’t think of this as cheating to have such information to hand. There are far too many functions to remember all of them!\n\n\n\nBefore using any of these functions, we need to load the library:-\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nselecting columns\nWe can access the columns of a data frame using the select function. This lets us have control over what is printed to the screen. Admitedly the dataset we are using here is rather small (being only six columns), but these useful functions really shine when faced with 10s or 100s of columns\n\nby name\nFirstly, we can select column by name, by adding bare column names (i.e. not requiring quote marks around the name) after the name of the data frame, separated by a , .\n\nselect(gapminder, country, continent)\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 2\n   country     continent\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 Afghanistan Asia     \n 2 Afghanistan Asia     \n 3 Afghanistan Asia     \n 4 Afghanistan Asia     \n 5 Afghanistan Asia     \n 6 Afghanistan Asia     \n 7 Afghanistan Asia     \n 8 Afghanistan Asia     \n 9 Afghanistan Asia     \n10 Afghanistan Asia     \n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\nNow lets imagine that we want to see all the columns apart from country. It would quickly become tedious, not to mention and prone to error, if we had to type every column name we wanted to keep by-hand.\nThankfully, we can also omit columns from the ouput by putting a minus (-) in front of the column name. Note that this is not the same as removing the column from the data permanently.\n\nselect(gapminder, -country)\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 5\n   continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Asia       1987    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr package has been carefully developed over the years with the needs of the data analyst in mind. Ideally we would rather be spending our time exploring and understanding data than writing reams of code. For this reason, you will often find a helpful function for a common task.\nIf you find yourself having to write lots of code to achieve a data manipulation task, the chances are the a convenient function already exists.\n\n\n\n\n\nrange of columns\nA range of columns can be selected by the : operator.\n\nselect(gapminder, lifeExp:gdpPercap)\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 3\n   lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9    41.7 16317921      649.\n10    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\n\n\nhelper functions\nThere are a number of helper functions can be employed if we are unsure about the exact name of the column.\n\nselect(gapminder, starts_with(\"co\"))\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 2\n   country     continent\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 Afghanistan Asia     \n 2 Afghanistan Asia     \n 3 Afghanistan Asia     \n 4 Afghanistan Asia     \n 5 Afghanistan Asia     \n 6 Afghanistan Asia     \n 7 Afghanistan Asia     \n 8 Afghanistan Asia     \n 9 Afghanistan Asia     \n10 Afghanistan Asia     \n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\nselect(gapminder, contains(\"life\"))\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 1\n   lifeExp\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1    28.8\n 2    30.3\n 3    32.0\n 4    34.0\n 5    36.1\n 6    38.4\n 7    39.9\n 8    40.8\n 9    41.7\n10    41.8\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n# selecting the last and penultimate columns\nselect(gapminder, last_col(1),last_col())\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 2\n        pop gdpPercap\n      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  8425333      779.\n 2  9240934      821.\n 3 10267083      853.\n 4 11537966      836.\n 5 13079460      740.\n 6 14880372      786.\n 7 12881816      978.\n 8 13867957      852.\n 9 16317921      649.\n10 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\nIt is also possible to use the column number in the selection.\n\nselect(gapminder, 4:6)\n\n# A tibble: 862 × 3\n   lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9    41.7 16317921      649.\n10    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 852 more rows\n\n\nThe select function can be used with just a single column name - in a similar manner to the $ operation we saw in Part 1.

If you only wanted to use the %&gt;% and not any other part of dplyr it would be quite inefficient to load the entire dplyr package as part of your code.\nAn equivalent |&gt; operation is available as part of base R. This means you can use piping without having to load the whole of dplyr. This is not an issue for these materials since we are working with dplyr quite a lot, but worth mentioning for completeness as you may see |&gt; used elsewhere. The code is exactly the same.\n\nfilter(gapminder, year == 2002) |&gt;\n  arrange(continent, desc(gdpPercap)) |&gt;\n  select(-year)\n\n# A tibble: 71 × 5\n   country           continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Gabon             Africa       56.8  1299304    12522.\n 2 Botswana          Africa       46.6  1630347    11004.\n 3 Equatorial Guinea Africa       49.3   495627     7703.\n 4 Algeria           Africa       71.0 31287142     5288.\n 5 Egypt             Africa       69.8 73312559     4755.\n 6 Congo, Rep.

    "text": "Basic plot types\nA plot in ggplot2 is created with the following type of command. N.B. please dont try and run this code, it just an overall sketch of what our ggplot2 code will look like.\nggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;, mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) +  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;()\nSo we need to specify\n\nThe data to be used in graph\nMappings of data to the graph (aesthetic mapping)\nWhat type of graph we want to use (The geom to use).\n\nLets say that we want to explore the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy. We might start with the hypothesis that richer countries have higher life expectancy. A sensible choice of plot would be a scatter plot with gdp on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis.\nThe first stage is to specify our dataset using the data argument. ggplot2 is great, but not clever enough to know what kind of plot we might want. It just creates a blank canvas.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = gapminder)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the aesthetics, as a bare minimum we will map the gdpPercap and lifeExp to the x- and y-axis of the plot. Some progress is made; we at least get axes\n\nggplot(data = gapminder,aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat created the axes, but we still need to define how to display our points on the plot. As we have continuous data for both the x- and y-axis, geom_point is a good choice.\n\nggplot(data = gapminder,aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geom we use will depend on what kind of data we have (continuous, categorical etc)\n\ngeom_point() - Scatter plots\ngeom_line() - Line plots\ngeom_smooth() - Fitted line plots\ngeom_bar() - Bar plots\ngeom_boxplot() - Boxplots\ngeom_jitter() - Jitter to plots\ngeom_histogram() - Histogram plots\ngeom_density() - Density plots\ngeom_text() - Text to plots\ngeom_errorbar() - Errorbars to plots\ngeom_violin() - Violin plots\ngeom_tile() - for “heatmap”-like plots\n\nBoxplots are commonly used to visualise the distributions of continuous data. We have to use a categorical variable on the x-axis such as continent or country (not advisable in this case as there are too many different values).\nThe order of the boxes along the x-axis is dictated by the order of categories in the factor; with the default for names being alphabetical order.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y=gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram is a common method for visualising a distribution of numeric values. Your data are split into a number of bins (which can be altered in the code) across the whole data range, and the number of observations in each bin is shown on the y-axis. Thus you can see where the majority of your data points are\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap)) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor categorical data, e.g. the country of continent columns in our case, a barplot will show the number of times each category is observed. The geom_bar will do the job of counting and plotting.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x=continent)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have particular numeric values you want to display in a barplot you can use geom_col. To give an example we will first filter the data to a particular year and continent. The gdpPercap values for each country can then be plotted. In the below plot the axis labels will be messy and difficult to read. This is something that can be customised with some of the ggplot2 options we will explore later.\n\ngapminder2002 &lt;- filter(gapminder, year==2002,continent==\"Americas\")\n\n## Notice that we plot the variable we have just created and not gapminder\n## You could also do this in one step using the piping technique for earlier\n\nggplot(gapminder2002, aes(x=country,y=gdpPercap)) + geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere appropriate, we can add multiple layers of geoms to the plot. For instance, a criticism of the boxplot is that it does not show all the data. We can rectify this by overlaying the individual points. This can give a representation of how many data points there are.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y=gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the default x-coordinate is always the same for each category. Adding some random “noise” to the x-axis can help using geom_jitter.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y=gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width=0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\nThe violin plot is a popular alternative to the boxplot. Create a violin plot with geom_violin to visualise the differences in GDP between different continents.\nCreate a subset of the gapminder data frame containing just the rows for your country of birth\nHas there been an increase in life expectancy over time?\n\nvisualise the trend using a scatter plot (geom_point), line graph (geom_line) or smoothed line (geom_smooth).\n\nWhat happens when you modify the geom_boxplot example to compare the gdp distributions for different years?\n\nLook at the message ggplot2 prints above the plot and try to modify the code to give a separate boxplot for each year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_violin()\n\n## I choose United Kingdom here, but pick a different one if you like\n\nuk_data &lt;- filter(gapminder, country == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n## As a scatter plot\nggplot(uk_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()\n\n## As a line plot\nggplot(uk_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_line()\n\n## With a smoothed line\nggplot(uk_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_smooth()\n\n\n## more than one of the above\n## You can also fit a straight line (via a linear model) by changing method\n\nggplot(uk_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n## this exercise could also make use of the piping technique\n\nfilter(gapminder, country == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\n\n# this is how we might expect the code to look like\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n# The previous output hints that you might want to group by year - otherwise it thinks that year is a numerical variable\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, group=year)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n# You may sometimes see this as a possible solution which fixes the year to be a categorical variable\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we have seen already, ggplot offers an interface to create many popular plot types. It is up to the user to decide what the best way to visualise the data."

In other words we can use a column in our dataset.\nLet’s say that we want points on our plot to be coloured according to continent. We add an extra argument to the definition of aesthetics to define the mapping. ggplot2 will even decide on colours and create a legend for us.

Admitedly the dataset we are using here is rather small (being only six columns), but these useful functions really shine when faced with 10s or 100s of columns\n\nby name\nFirstly, we can select column by name, by adding bare column names (i.e. not requiring quote marks around the name) after the name of the data frame, separated by a , .\n\nselect(gapminder, country, continent)\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 2\n   country     continent\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 Afghanistan Asia     \n 2 Afghanistan Asia     \n 3 Afghanistan Asia     \n 4 Afghanistan Asia     \n 5 Afghanistan Asia     \n 6 Afghanistan Asia     \n 7 Afghanistan Asia     \n 8 Afghanistan Asia     \n 9 Afghanistan Asia     \n10 Afghanistan Asia     \n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\nNow lets imagine that we want to see all the columns apart from country.

This can make the plot more appealing, but also help with data interpretation. In this case, we can use different colours to indicate countries belonging to different continents. For example, we can see a cluster of Asia data points with unusually large GDP.

    "text": "Facets\nOne very useful feature of ggplot2 is faceting. This allows you to produce plots for subsets and groupings in your data (aka “facets”). In the scatter plot above, it was quite difficult to determine if the relationship between gdp and life expectancy was the same for each continent. To overcome this, we would like a see a separate plot for each continent.\nIn we attempted such a task manually we might start off by plotting Africa\n\nafr_plot&lt;- gapminder %&gt;% \n  filter(continent == \"Africa\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\nafr_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the same for Americas:-\n\namr_plot &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% \n  filter(continent == \"Americas\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\namr_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point we will have to stitch the plots together (which is possible, but we will cover this later) and make sure we have equivalent scales for all plots. In this setup we are manually specifying the name of the continent, which is prone to error. Again, we could use something like a for loop to make the plots for each continent. However, we aren’t covering such techniques in these materials as dplyr and ggplot2 don’t tend to require them.\nAs we said before, dplyr, and ggplot2 are built with the analyst in mind and have many useful features for automating some common tasks. To achieve the plot we want is surprisingly simple. To “facet” our data into multiple plots we can use the facet_wrap (1 variable) or facet_grid (2 variables) functions and specify the variable(s) we split by.\n\np + facet_wrap(~continent) + scale_x_log10() + xlab(\"GDP (log10)\") + ylab(\"Life Expectancy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facet_grid function will create a grid-like plot with one variable on the x-axis and another on the y-axis.\n\np + facet_grid(continent~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous plot was a bit messy as it contained all combinations of year and continent. Let’s suppose we want our analysis to be a bit more focused and disregard countries in Oceania (as there are only 2 in our dataset) and maybe years between 1997 and 2002. However, we can only “add” more information from our plots and not take anything away. Therefore the suggested approach is to pre-filter and manipulate the data into the form you want for plotting.\nWeknow how to restrict the rows from the gapminder dataset using the filter function. Instead of filtering the data, creating a new data frame, and constructing the data frame from these new data we can use the%&gt;% operator to create the data frame “on the fly” and pass directly to ggplot. Thus we don’t have to save a new data frame or alter the original data.\n\nfilter(gapminder, continent!=\"Oceania\", year %in% c(1997,2002,2007)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp,col=continent)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(continent~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is lots more to cover on ggplot2 and quickly we can start to understand our data without too much in the way of coding. When it comes to reporting and justifying our findings we will need to produce some numerical summaries. We tackle this in the next section."

The helper function last_col() is incredibly useful for this as we don’t need to know the name of the column. Using summarise we can add all the values in the column. This is the cumulative number of casees at the last date in the dataset. Dividing by one million (1e6) makes the numbers a bit easier to read.\n\nfilter(covid, `Country/Region` == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;% \n  select(last_col()) %&gt;% \n  summarise(sum(.) / 1e6)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(.)/1e+06`\n           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1           24.7\n\n\nFor the truncated dataset, the number of counts is substantially lower as we are missing the mainland Uk data.

Since no errors were produced I might not have detected the problem if I wasn’t trying to visualise data for United Kingdom which happened to be located towards the bottom of the file.\nChecking the dimensions of the tibble help to diagnose the problem, but there are couple of other techniques. R has an in-built function to check the size of a file.\n\nfile.size(\"raw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\")\n\n[1] 1820194\n\n\n\nfile.size(\"time_series_covid19_confirmed_global_BAD.csv\")\n\n[1] 1714255\n\n\nA bit more rigourous is to calculate a checksum. In short, this is a calculated value that represents the exact contents of a file. If the file changes — even by a single byte — the checksum changes as well. That’s why it’s often described as a “digital fingerprint” for data integrity. This can be done in R by first loading the tools library and using the md5sum function.\n\n# Load the tools package\nlibrary(tools)\n\n# Compute MD5 checksum for a file\nfile_path &lt;- \"path/to/your/file.txt\"\nchecksum &lt;- md5sum(\"raw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv\")\nchecksum\n\nraw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv \n               \"095dfec62d4981a32630bed5094296f7\" \n\n\n\nchecksum_bad &lt;- md5sum(\"time_series_covid19_confirmed_global_BAD.csv\")\nchecksum_bad\n\ntime_series_covid19_confirmed_global_BAD.csv \n          \"179af9d326d1c9451c49e5d9821c85e0\" \n\n\nIn practice if someone is sending data you large, especially if the file is large, they will also send a file containing checksums for you to check data integrity. The following would print TRUE if both files had exactly the same contents.\n\nchecksum == checksum_bad\n\nraw_data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv \n                                            FALSE"

The Title and Author boxes can be filled with anything you like. They are used when you want to create a report document from your code. A new panel should appear in RStudio which is your bare bones analysis. The title and author lines should correspond to the text you entered (if any) when creating the document\nR code can be added to this document by clicking the “Insert Code Chunk” toolbar option\n\nThis will give you space to type or paste R code from the tutorial. In the below screenshot, R code can be entered between lines 8 and 10. Pressing ENTER between these lines will allow more code to be written. Pressing CTRL + ENTER causes the code to be run.\n\nLines outside of a code chunk can be used to write any explanations or interpretations of the plots, stats that you produce along the way.\nAt this point you are working on an untitled document that is not saved to disk.

    "text": "RNA-seq processing\nIn this short section, we will briefly describe the pre-processing of RNA-seq data which is not typically done in R. If you are only interested in using R, you may skip to the next section.\nThere are many steps involved in analysing an RNA-Seq experiment.\n\n(Workflow image from Harvard Bioinformatics Core)\nAnalysing an RNAseq experiment begins with sequencing reads. These are large (typically several Gb) that contain information on the sequences that have been generated for each biological sample; one fastq (or pair of fastqs) for each sample. Each set of four lines describe one sequence (called a “read”).\nA typical RNA-seq experiment will have 10 - 30 million reads in a fastq file, with each read about 100 bases long. e.g.\n@D0UW5ACXX120511:8:1204:6261:40047/1\nAATGTTTATGTTCTTAAATTTTAGTTGTATATGTGAATCTTTGTAGTTTTTGCTAAAATACTAAGTAATTTATATAAAAGTGAGTTAAGAGATTTTTCTGA\n+\nCCCFFFFFHHHHHJJJJJIJJJJJIJJHIIJIJIJJIJJJIJJHIIHIJJJJJJBEGIHIJICGIDICFGIJJJIIJJGJ&gt;F&gt;GAGCGEEHEHHEEFFFD&gt;\nAs the fastq files are large, we tend to analyse them using command-line software and a computing cluster. The traditional workflow for RNA-seq compares the sequences to a reference genome to see which genomic region each read matches the best.\n\nAgain, this requires more memory than a typical laptop or desktop machine so is performed on a remote computer with large memory. The resulting file is called a bam and records the best genomic match for each read. However, as we are interested in gene expression we want to relate these mappings to the positions of genes.\nA variety of different counting methods can determine how many reads overlap each known gene region. These are know as the raw counts and are the kind of data we will start with today.\n\nRecent tools for RNA-seq analysis (e.g. salmon, kallisto) do not require the time-consuming step of whole-genome alignment to be performed, and can therefore produce gene-level counts in a much faster time frame. They not require the creation of large bam files, which is useful if constrained by file space (e.g. if using Galaxy).\nMy strong recommendation would be to use the nextflow workflow system in conjunction with the nf.core pipeline to align and quantify your RNA-seq reads. My former colleague Dr. Lewis Quayle has a really good write-up of using nf.core on his pages\n\nhttps://www.lewisdoesdata.com/2024/05/01/bulk-rnaseq-end-to-end-part-1.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUnless you are doing something extremely novel and bespoke I don’t believe it would be worth writing your own pipeline for processing RNA-seq, or any other sequencing data, from scratch rather than using what is available in nf.core."

    "section": "About “metadata”",
    "text": "About “metadata”\nModern sequencing devices are truly remarkable machines capable of taking biological material and generating vast amounts of biological sequence. However, they know nothing about the biological context of the experiment taking place - nor do they need to. If you are a researcher requesting sequencing from a Core facility you will typically submit a set of test tubes (containing prepared sequencing libraries) along with a spreadsheet giving a name to each sample. These names can be as simple as “Sample 1”, “Sample 2” etc. When the data come back from sequencing, the raw data will retain the labels “Sample 1”, “Sample 2”. We refer to metadata as the data that describes the biological and technical characteristics of the samples we have sequenced\n. Examples of variables recorded in the metadata might include.\n\ntumour / normal status\ncell line\nage\ngender\ndate of collection\nlitter\n\nWe include the sample groups that we want to compare, and any potential confounding factors that we might need to address as part of our quality assessment. The metadata is stored in a spreadsheet and typically entered by-hand. When creating such data we should be mindful of some best-practice guidelines that will make our data easier to read into R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSee here for a round-up of common errors to be avoiding when creating spreadsheets\n\nData Carpentry lesson on spreadsheet errors\n\n\n\nThe sampleInfo.csv in the meta_data folder contains basic information about the samples that we will need for the analysis today. This includes the ID for the sample ID assigned by the researcher (Run), the experimental condition (condition), shorter name for the sample (Name), the replicate number (Replicate) and whether the sample is a control or treated sample (Treated).\n\nsampleInfo &lt;- read.csv(\"meta_data/sampleInfo.csv\")\nsampleInfo\n\n          Run condition  Name Replicate Treated\n1  1_CTR_BC_2       CTR CTR_1         1       N\n2  2_TGF_BC_4       TGF TGF_1         1       Y\n3   3_IR_BC_5        IR  IR_1         1       Y\n4  4_CTR_BC_6       CTR CTR_2         2       N\n5  5_TGF_BC_7       TGF TGF_2         2       Y\n6  6_IR_BC_12        IR  IR_2         2       Y\n7 7_CTR_BC_13       ctr CTR_3         3       N\n8 8_TGF_BC_14       tgf TGF_3         3       Y\n9  9_IR_BC_15        ir  IR_3         3       Y\n\n\nIf you want to know how to create such a data frame based on the column names alone (i.e. if no csv file was provided), read the following note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferring the sample information from the count column names\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is sometimes possible to create a meta data spreadsheet if none is available. This relies on the column names of the count matrix being named in a consistent fashion. In this example we can see that the biological group (CTR, TGF or IR) is encoded in the name and the column names contain a _ character. The stringr and tidyr packages include the functionality for dealing cleaning these data.\n\nstringr reference guide\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"stringr\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyr\")\n\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n## Get the column names of counts - except the first column which is the gene name\ncols &lt;- colnames(counts)[-1]\ncols \n\n[1] \"1_CTR_BC_2\"  \"2_TGF_BC_4\"  \"3_IR_BC_5\"   \"4_CTR_BC_6\"  \"5_TGF_BC_7\" \n[6] \"6_IR_BC_12\"  \"7_CTR_BC_13\" \"8_TGF_BC_14\" \"9_IR_BC_15\" \n\n\nThe column names consists of various letters separated by a _. Some of these can be used to form the conditions and replicate information, and the separate function from tidyr is an efficient way of splitting the Run column into different components. The BC and number at the each of the name is not actually useful analysis, so we will remove in the next step. The remove = FALSE argument is used to keep the Run column in the data.\n\nmeta &lt;- data.frame(Run = cols) %&gt;% \n  separate(Run, into = c(\"Sample Number\", \"condition\", \"BC\", \"X\"),remove = FALSE)\nmeta\n\n          Run Sample Number condition BC  X\n1  1_CTR_BC_2             1       CTR BC  2\n2  2_TGF_BC_4             2       TGF BC  4\n3   3_IR_BC_5             3        IR BC  5\n4  4_CTR_BC_6             4       CTR BC  6\n5  5_TGF_BC_7             5       TGF BC  7\n6  6_IR_BC_12             6        IR BC 12\n7 7_CTR_BC_13             7       CTR BC 13\n8 8_TGF_BC_14             8       TGF BC 14\n9  9_IR_BC_15             9        IR BC 15\n\n\nNow we keep the columns we need, and add the replicate numbers using the rep function to repeat a sequence 1,2,3 three times. The shorter name is formed by pasting the condition and replicate number (using paste with a _ separator. Finally, Treated column is formed using an ifelse statement. This is used to test if a particular value of condition is equal to CTR or not. If it is, a value of N is used in the new Treated column. If not, the value of Y is used instead.\n\nmeta &lt;- select(meta, Run, condition) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Replicate = rep(c(1,2,3), 3)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Name = paste(condition, Replicate, sep = \"_\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Treated = ifelse(condition == \"CTR\", \"N\", \"Y\"))\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we can use basic R commands to read the counts and sample information into R, it is much more common to use specialist software for further analysis. Packages such as DESeq2 (used in this tutorial), edgeR and limma have evolved other many years to offer an efficient way of storing and manipulating complex datasets.\n\nlibrary(DESeq2)\n\nThe DESeq2 allows data to be imported from various formats, and the option we will be using here is that of a counts matrix. The “vignette” for DESeq2 is incredibly detailed, and offers code for importing data produced by different software\n\nDESeq2 Guide\n\nHowever, as we said the count matrix is the most common. It is important to note, as described in the vignette, that your counts must be raw and not subjected to any kind of normalisation or calibration. These steps are included in the standard workflow as we will see.\nThe code to import our data as given below. We also have to specify at this point a design for analysis. In the simplest terms this is essentially telling DESeq2 which column in our dataset to use when making comparisons between groups. DESeq2 will not actually do any differential expression unless we tell it to, so this is just a placeholder value for now. We can also introduce more complicated designs that might more than one column.\nWe would normally think of a “count matrix” as containing just numeric data. Our counts contains gene identifiers which might usually be a problem but DESeq2 is still able to import the data if we set tidy=TRUE.\n\ndds &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, \n                                  colData = sampleInfo, \n                                  design = ~condition, tidy = TRUE)\n\nWarning in DESeqDataSet(se, design = design, ignoreRank): some variables in\ndesign formula are characters, converting to factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning about “converting to factors”\n\n\n\nYou will probably get a Warning message including the phrase some variables in design formula are characters, converting to factors. This is perfectly fine and just means that DESeq2 has converted some columns in your sample information from characters into factors. i.e. a column containing a categorical variable.\n\n\nPrinting the contents of dds to the screen gives some details of how the data are represented, and happily for us it does not print all the contents to the screen\n\ndds\n\nclass: DESeqDataSet \ndim: 57914 9 \nmetadata(1): version\nassays(1): counts\nrownames(57914): ENSG00000000003 ENSG00000000005 ...

The head function is used so that only the first six rows (genes) are shown.\nThe gene names that appear in the rows are clearly not very useful for us now, but these can be converted into something more manageable when we come to interpret our data.\n\nhead(counts(dds))\n\n                1_CTR_BC_2 2_TGF_BC_4 3_IR_BC_5 4_CTR_BC_6 5_TGF_BC_7\nENSG00000000003       1579       1547      1342       1704       1395\nENSG00000000005          0          0         0          0          0\nENSG00000000419       1774       1775      1866       1809       1921\nENSG00000000457        698        617       601        733        662\nENSG00000000460        246        309       116        224        255\nENSG00000000938         10          5        11          6          1\n                6_IR_BC_12 7_CTR_BC_13 8_TGF_BC_14 9_IR_BC_15\nENSG00000000003       1264        1556        1370       1269\nENSG00000000005          0           0           0          1\nENSG00000000419       1776        1797        1482       1980\nENSG00000000457        537         751         593        628\nENSG00000000460        108         245         289        127\nENSG00000000938          2          19           4          8\n\n\nWhereas colData will display the meta data that has been stored with the object.\n\ncolData(dds)\n\nDataFrame with 9 rows and 5 columns\n                    Run condition        Name Replicate     Treated\n            &lt;character&gt;  &lt;factor&gt; &lt;character&gt; &lt;integer&gt; &lt;character&gt;\n1_CTR_BC_2   1_CTR_BC_2       CTR       CTR_1         1           N\n2_TGF_BC_4   2_TGF_BC_4       TGF       TGF_1         1           Y\n3_IR_BC_5     3_IR_BC_5       IR         IR_1         1           Y\n4_CTR_BC_6   4_CTR_BC_6       CTR       CTR_2         2           N\n5_TGF_BC_7   5_TGF_BC_7       TGF       TGF_2         2           Y\n6_IR_BC_12   6_IR_BC_12       IR         IR_2         2           Y\n7_CTR_BC_13 7_CTR_BC_13       ctr       CTR_3         3           N\n8_TGF_BC_14 8_TGF_BC_14       tgf       TGF_3         3           Y\n9_IR_BC_15   9_IR_BC_15       ir         IR_3         3           Y\n\n\nIndividual columns from the metadata can also be accessed and printed using the $ notation.

First, we can check how many reads we have for each sample in the DESeqDataSet. We will never get exactly the same total of total counts for each sample, but they should be roughly the same. Low total number of counts could be indicative of poor quality sample.\nThe counts themselves are accessed using the counts function; giving a matrix of counts. The sum of a particular column is therefore the total number of reads for that sample.\n\nsum(counts(dds)[,1])\n\n[1] 37966392\n\n\nA convenience function colSums exists for calculating the sum of each column in a matrix, returning a vector as a result.\n\ncolSums(counts(dds))\n\n 1_CTR_BC_2  2_TGF_BC_4   3_IR_BC_5  4_CTR_BC_6  5_TGF_BC_7  6_IR_BC_12 \n   37966392    42302453    33300002    39401879    37716366    32599748 \n7_CTR_BC_13 8_TGF_BC_14  9_IR_BC_15 \n   34273109    38522174    36478190 \n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\nUse an appropriate function from dplyr to add a column containing the number of reads for each sample to the sampleInfo data frame.\nProduce a bar plot to show the Millions of reads for each sample (see below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmutate(sampleInfo, LibSize = colSums(assay(dds))/1e6) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Name, y = LibSize)) + geom_col(fill=\"steelblue\") + geom_hline(yintercept = 20,col=\"red\",lty=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising count distributions\nWe typically use a boxplot to visualise difference the distributions of the columns of a numeric data frame. Applying the boxplot function to the raw counts from our dataset reveals something about the nature of the data; the distributions are dominated by a few genes with very large counts. We are using the base boxplot function here for convenience because the count data are not in the long data format required by ggplot2.\n\nboxplot(counts(dds))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the vst or rlog function from DESeq2to compensate for the effect of different library sizes and put the data on the log\\(_2\\) scale. The effect is to remove the dependence of the variance on the mean, particularly the high variance of the logarithm of count data when the mean is low. For more details see the DESeq2 vignette\n\n# Get log2 counts\nvsd &lt;- vst(dds)\n# Check distributions of samples using boxplots\nboxplot(assay(vsd), xlab=\"\", ylab=\"Log2 counts per million\",las=2,main=\"Normalised Distributions\")\n\nabline(h=median(assay(vsd)), col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that using vst has made the distributions more comparable, and indeed these transformed data will form the basis for most of our quality assessment. They are not however used for any differential analysis. DESeq2 has it’s own normalisation method"

A PCA is an example of an unsupervised analysis, where we don’t need to specify the groups. Each point in the plot is a biological sample in your dataset, and crucially the points can be coloured and labeled according to your metadata. If your experiment is well-controlled and has worked well, what we hope to see is that the greatest sources of variation in the data correspond to the treatments/groups we are interested in. In other words, the points on the plot should separate according to biological conditions.\nIt is also an incredibly useful tool for quality control and checking for outliers, and DESeq2 has a convenient plotPCA function for making the PCA plot, which makes use of the ggplot2 graphics package.\n\nplotPCA(vsd,intgroup=\"Treated\")\n\nusing ntop=500 top features by variance\n\n\nWarning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.\nℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.\nℹ See also `vignette(\"ggplot2-in-packages\")` for more information.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the DESeq2 package.\n  Please report the issue to the authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also an option to return the values used in the plot for further exploration and customisation. The ggplot2 package is a natural choice for plotting.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nplotPCA(vsd,intgroup=\"Treated\",returnData = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2,col=group)) + geom_point(size=3)\n\nusing ntop=500 top features by variance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PCA shown above is coloured according to the Treated status of each sample. An interpretation of this plot would be that samples separate cleanly based on Treated on the y-axis (PC2), with the non-treated samples (coloured red) having y coordinates around 10 and treated samples (coloured blue) having y coordinate around -5.\nHowever, the PCA method definition means that main source of variance cannot be explained by the Treated variable. Along the x-axis (PC1) we see three distinct groups. You would hope that these correspond to the condition, and we will assess this in the following exercise."

(HINT: check the documentation for the plotPCA function.)\nVerify that the samples are separated based on the condition.\nWhat problems can you see with the metadata?\nCan you label the identify of each sample? Look for help on geom_textif you haven’t used it before\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plotPCA function has an argument ntop which is used to specify how many genes are used to perform the PCA - so it is based on a limited set of genes in the data. The genes used are those with the highest variance.\nTo make a PCA based on condition we need to alter the intgroup argument\n\nplotPCA(vsd,intgroup=\"condition\",returnData = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2,col=condition)) + geom_point()\n\nusing ntop=500 top features by variance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis almost shows what we expect, but there are far too many colours used in the plot. This is because of discrepancies in the notation used for condition.\nIn order for geom_text to work you need to include an aesthetic mapping label in the initial ggplot call.\n\nplotPCA(vsd,intgroup=\"condition\",returnData = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2,col=condition, label=Name)) + geom_point() + geom_text()\n\nusing ntop=500 top features by variance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the placement of the labels is sometimes not very satisfactory. Better placement can be achieved by using the ggrepel package. The geom_text_repel function can then be used instead of geom_text.\n\nif(!require(ggrepel)) install.packages(\"ggrepel\")\n\nLoading required package: ggrepel\n\nplotPCA(vsd,intgroup=\"condition\",returnData = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2,col=condition, label=Name)) + geom_point() + ggrepel::geom_text_repel()\n\nusing ntop=500 top features by variance"

In particular the sva Bioconductor package can correct for batch effects provided that representatives of the groups of interest appear in each batch.

Such errors can be annoying when labeling plots, but have more serious consequences when attempting to fit statistical models to the data.\nHere are a set of commands to create an updated sample sheet using the stringr package (part of tidyverse).

As our counts are unchanged, the coordinates on the PCA remain the same.\n\n\n\nThe PCA produced when we used the corrected meta data gives us some confidence that our experiment has worked. Although it is tempting, we shouldn’t blindly correct errors in our meta data based on what we see on a PCA. Some detective work is required to make sure that the sample labeling is truly a mistake. Perhaps contact the lab personnel who processed the samples and review their lab notebook/LIMS records for the sample’s journey: RNA extraction -&gt; library preparation -&gt; index assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample swaps can also happen during the indexing/barcoding step of library preparation. The sample might have physically clustered with the intended group, but the sequencing machine labeled it with the wrong index.\nPCA is a critical diagnostic and exploratory tool that informs and guides the inferential analysis, not just a simple visualization technique. However, it is a descriptive technique, not an inferential one. In other words, it cannot actually be used to prove anything about your data such as a biological hypothesis. This will come in the next section when we look at differential expression.\nAnyway, now that we are happy with the pre-processing we will save our DESeq object to disk so we can start from this point\n\ndir.create(\"Robjects\", showWarnings = FALSE)\nsaveRDS(dds, \"Robjects/dds.rds\")\n\n\n\nWhat about tSNE and UMAP?

These are methods recommended for single-cell RNA-seq which are much sparser (have many 0 counts), more complex, and contains distinct cell types that often have non-linear relationships. For bulk RNA-seq though good old PCA is perfectly adequate as an exploratory method for visualising variation in your data\nIf you wish to explore PCA in a bit more detail, expand the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater control over PCA\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plotPCA function is perfectly serviceable and gives a good overview of your data.

    "text": "Why are some adjusted p-values “NA”?\nIt turns out that DESeq2 has already done some processing on the results to exclude genes with low expression level across the dataset that it deems to be unreliable and unlikely to be differential-expressed. The genes it filters out (those that have NA adjusted p-value) tend to have a lower value of baseMean.\n\nresults_annotated %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = is.na(padj), y = baseMean)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_y_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core principle is that genes with very low expression (low average normalized counts) have little power to be called differentially expressed, even if their true \\(\\log_2\\) fold change is comparatively large. By testing all genes, you incur a multiple testing penalty for these low-power genes, which reduces the number of genes that can be called significant overall.\nThe procedure first uses the mean of normalized counts (baseMean) across all samples as a filtering mechanism. Genes with very low expression have high \\(p\\)-values due to low statistical power (high variance relative to the mean), regardless of their true fold change. DESeq2 determines an optimal cutoff for the baseMean that maximizes the number of genes called significant (padj &lt; \\(\\alpha\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is usually \\(0.1\\) or \\(0.05\\)). This is done by testing a range of cutoffs and picking the one that yields the largest number of discoveries. Genes with mean counts below this optimal cutoff are removed (in practice their padj is set to NA). The remaining genes are then subjected to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. The benefit is a gain in statistical power. By reducing the total number of hypotheses tested, the multiple testing penalty is less severe, allowing more true positives (expressed genes with actual differential expression) to pass the adjusted \\(p\\)-value threshold.\nThe effect of filtering can be seen in the following histogram:-\n\nmutate(results_annotated, Filtered = is.na(padj)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = pvalue, fill = Filtered)) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe filtered group (in blue) represents the low-count genes that were removed. The distribution is typically nearly uniform or even shows a slight peak towards the lower \\(p\\)-values. If these low-power genes were included, the overall flat null distribution needed for accurate FDR control would be slightly inflated near zero, leading to a harsher multiple testing penalty.\nThe non-Filtered Group (e.g., shown in red) represents the genes with sufficient expression to be tested. This is the set of \\(p\\)-values actually used for the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment. This distribution should show a clear, desirable pattern: a strong peak near \\(p=0\\) (the true differentially expressed genes) and a flat, uniform distribution from \\(\\sim0.05\\) to \\(1\\) (the true null hypotheses).\nBy removing the “Filtered” genes, the adjusted \\(p\\)-values (padj) are calculated only on the well-behaved “Non-Filtered” set, resulting in more significant calls for the well-expressed genes.\nIf the details above seem complex, remember that DESeq2 will do these automatically without you having to think about them. If we think this behaviour isn’t desirable, or are curious to see the results without any adjustment, we can set the argument independentFiltering = FALSE in the results function."

    "text": "Shrinking the log fold-changes\nDESeq2 provides an estimate, for each gene, of the difference in mean expression between our groups. However, in the same way that the raw pvalues can be improved by the adjustment described about, we can also get better estimates of the log fold-changes (LFC).\nWhen we made the MA-plot in the previous section we saw a fanning effect at lower expression levels. A technique called “shrinkage” helps to address this as the “shrunken” log fold-change is a better measure of biological magnitude for ranking genes.\nLog fold-change shrinkage, implemented in DESeq2 via the lfcShrink() function, uses a statistical technique called Bayesian shrinkage (or an Empirical Bayes approach) to address this.\nIt works by:\n\n“Borrowing” Information: It assumes that most genes are not differentially expressed (i.e., most true LFCs are near zero).\n“Shrinking”: For genes with low counts (low confidence in the LFC), it shrinks their estimated LFC closer to zero.\nLeaving Alone: For genes with high counts (high confidence in the LFC), the shrinkage effect is minimal, leaving the raw LFC largely untouched.\n\nTo use lfcShrink we have to supply the initial run of the DESeq pipeline (saved as de_condition in our case) and pay careful attention to the number of the coefficient that we want to apply shrinkage to. Running the resultsNames function prints that names of the coefficients, so TGF_vs_CTR is numbered coefficient 3.

    "section": "Threshold-based Gene Set Testing",
    "text": "Threshold-based Gene Set Testing\nThreshold-based or Over-representation analysis is used once we have decided a list of DE genes that we are happy with. The analysis then looks for gene sets that are over-represented, or occur more than we would expect by chance.\nclusterProfiler is a Bioconductor package for pathways and downstream analysis and it’s main advantage is that it provides some nice visualisation methods.\nThe function for over-representation analysis on Gene Ontologies is enrichGO which requires the IDs of genes found to be DE (sigGenes) and the IDs of all genes in the dataset (universe). It uses the org.Hs.eg.db package to map between gene names and biological pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUnlike the DESeq workflow in the previous section, which reports all genes regardless of their significance, enrichGO only reports significant pathways based on the qvalueCutoff and pvalueCutoff arguments. If you want to see all the results regardless of significance you can set these values to 1.\nThe p.adjust and qvalue columns refers to two separate but related methods for multiple testing. p.adjust uses the the Benjamini-Hochberg (\\(\\text{BH}\\)) method (also called \\(\\text{FDR}\\) or \\(\\text{BH}\\)), which is a common and robust method for controlling the \\(\\text{FDR}\\). This is a step-up method that adjusts the raw \\(P\\)-value for each term. If you set a \\(\\text{BH}\\) cutoff of \\(0.05\\), you are stating that you expect at most 5% of your rejected null hypotheses (your significant terms) to be false discoveries (i.e., enriched by chance). Therefore the value in the \\(\\text{p.adjust}\\) column is the lowest \\(\\text{FDR}\\) you can tolerate while still declaring that specific term significant.\nThe qvalue column comes from a method developed by John Storey, often implemented via the qvalue R package, which is frequently used for high-throughput data. The \\(\\text{Q}\\)-value is an estimate of the minimum expected \\(\\text{FDR}\\) incurred when declaring a specific term significant. Unlike the \\(\\text{BH}\\) method, the \\(\\text{Q}\\)-value method estimates the proportion of true null hypotheses (\\(\\pi_0\\)) present in the data, leading to a potentially more powerful (less conservative) adjustment. If a term has a \\(\\text{Q}\\)-value of \\(0.01\\), it means that if you choose that value as your significance cutoff, you expect 1% of the terms declared significant to be false positives. Consequently the value in the \\(\\text{qvalue}\\) column is generally lower (more stringent) than the \\(\\text{p.adjust}\\) value because it uses the estimated \\(\\pi_0\\) to adjust the calculation.\n\n\n\nlibrary(clusterProfiler)\nuniverse &lt;- results_final %&gt;% pull(ENSEMBL)\nsigGenes &lt;- results_final %&gt;% \n  filter(padj &lt; 0.05) %&gt;% pull(ENSEMBL)\n\nenrich_go &lt;- enrichGO(\n  gene= sigGenes,\n  OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db,\n  keyType = \"ENSEMBL\",\n  ont = \"BP\",\n  universe = universe,\n  qvalueCutoff = 0.05,\n  readable=TRUE\n)\n\nThe result of enrichGo can be turned into a data frame for easier interpretation.\n\nenrich_go %&gt;% data.frame %&gt;% \n  slice_head(n = 10) %&gt;% \n  select(-geneID)\n\n                   ID                                   Description GeneRatio\nGO:2001233 GO:2001233     regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway  164/4221\nGO:0045229 GO:0045229 external encapsulating structure organization  145/4221\nGO:0030198 GO:0030198             extracellular matrix organization  144/4221\nGO:0043062 GO:0043062          extracellular structure organization  144/4221\nGO:0036293 GO:0036293           response to decreased oxygen levels  140/4221\nGO:0001666 GO:0001666                           response to hypoxia  135/4221\nGO:0070482 GO:0070482                     response to oxygen levels  148/4221\nGO:0006979 GO:0006979                  response to oxidative stress  162/4221\nGO:0001503 GO:0001503                                  ossification  176/4221\nGO:0051338 GO:0051338            regulation of transferase activity  176/4221\n             BgRatio RichFactor FoldEnrichment   zScore       pvalue\nGO:2001233 398/18429  0.4120603       1.799066 8.784050 1.565104e-16\nGO:0045229 341/18429  0.4252199       1.856522 8.701630 3.876853e-16\nGO:0030198 339/18429  0.4247788       1.854596 8.656085 5.449599e-16\nGO:0043062 340/18429  0.4235294       1.849141 8.613749 7.346873e-16\nGO:0036293 328/18429  0.4268293       1.863548 8.601070 8.622993e-16\nGO:0001666 314/18429  0.4299363       1.877114 8.544404 1.403743e-15\nGO:0070482 356/18429  0.4157303       1.815090 8.464390 1.955033e-15\nGO:0006979 406/18429  0.3990148       1.742109 8.241337 7.442020e-15\nGO:0001503 458/18429  0.3842795       1.677775 8.005937 3.121776e-14\nGO:0051338 463/18429  0.3801296       1.659656 7.835427 9.807162e-14\n               p.adjust       qvalue Count\nGO:2001233 9.855460e-13 6.741479e-13   164\nGO:0045229 1.085980e-12 7.428482e-13   145\nGO:0030198 1.085980e-12 7.428482e-13   144\nGO:0043062 1.085980e-12 7.428482e-13   144\nGO:0036293 1.085980e-12 7.428482e-13   140\nGO:0001666 1.473228e-12 1.007740e-12   135\nGO:0070482 1.758692e-12 1.203007e-12   148\nGO:0006979 5.857800e-12 4.006940e-12   162\nGO:0001503 2.184203e-11 1.494071e-11   176\nGO:0051338 6.175570e-11 4.224306e-11   176\n\n\nThe output data frame is using the same approaches discussed above and the GeneRatio and BgRatio columns tell you for each row (pathway) how many genes in that pathway were found in the DE genes (GeneRatio), and in the background (BgRatio). The FoldEnrichment indicates how many more times each pathway is represented than you would expect. Somewhat reassuringly the ECM pathway is found among these most significant pathways. A dot plot can show us the most enriched pathways, their statistical significance, and the size of each.\n\nenrichplot::dotplot(enrich_go,showCategory=20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might notice that the names of some pathways, and the numbers of genes they contain are extremely similar. For example extracellular matrix organization and extracellular structure organization. This is because Gene Ontologies are not mutually exclusive and can comprise the same genes. The results can therefore give a false impression of how many biological functions are being represented amongst the results. Overlaps between gene sets can also be visualised using an “Upset plot” - an alternative to a venn diagram. The connected dots in the bottom panel show genes that are shared between different pathways, and the number of these genes is displayed in the bar chart.\n\nenrichplot::upsetplot(enrich_go)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe emapplot function is another way of identifying redundancy and clustering the enrichment results into broader biological themes. For instance, terms like “cell proliferation,” “cell division,” and “mitotic nuclear division” would all cluster together, indicating they represent the single, large theme of “cell cycle.”\nEach node in this plot represents a significantly enriched pathway or GO term. Whereas an edge (line) connects two nodes if their underlying gene sets overlap significantly (i.e., they share many common genes).\n\nenrich_go &lt;- enrichplot::pairwise_termsim(enrich_go)\nemapplot(enrich_go)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA gene-concept network plot (cnetplot) depicts the linkages of genes and biological concepts (e.g. GO terms or KEGG pathways) as a network. This plot can identify the core “hub” genes (genes with high connectivity) that are common to multiple enriched pathways. These hub genes are often considered the most critical players driving the observed biological change.\n\ncnetplot(enrich_go)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheheatplot is another way of visualising pathway overlaps. In this plot, each column is a gene and a black box indicating if that gene features in a given pathway.\n\nheatplot(enrich_go, showCategory = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the treeplot function performs hierarchical clustering of enriched terms. It relies on the pairwise similarities of the enriched terms calculated by the pairwise_termsim() function, which by default usese the Jaccard’s similarity index (JC).\n\nenrich_go &lt;- enrichplot::pairwise_termsim(enrich_go)\nenrichplot::treeplot(enrich_go)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Simplifying” the GO results\nAs noted, GO terms contain a lot of redundancy due to its hierarchical nature. We can however tackle this issue using the simplify function. In order to understand the impact we will first make a note of how many pathways are in the un-simplified output.\n\nenrich_go %&gt;% data.frame() %&gt;% nrow\n\n[1] 1486\n\n\n“Similarity” in this case refers to semantic similarity as implemented in the GOSemSim package. Semantic similarity, in the context of Gene Ontology (GO),cis a quantitative measure of how functionally related two GO terms are. It goes beyond simple gene sharing by assessing the terms’ proximity within the GO hierarchy (the Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG). Two terms are highly similar if they share a common ancestor deep in the hierarchy, indicating a functional relationship, regardless of whether their gene lists overlap perfectly. This method ensures that terms covering the same core biological concept are grouped together.\nIf two or more GO terms are found to be highly similar (i.e., their similarity score meets or exceeds the defined cutoff), simplify() considers them redundant and removes one of them by for example picking the term with the most significant p-value.\n\n## This may take a while to

    "text": "Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)\nAn appealing feature of the GSEA method is that it does not require us to impose arbitrary cut-offs on the dataset to decide what is DE or not. Instead it takes a set of ranked statistics for all genes and looks for sets of genes that occur either at the top or bottom of the list. As GSEA uses the direction of a test result (either up- or down-regulated) the test statistics themselves must have a positive or negative sign. Although the p-values cannot therefore be used for this purpose, they can be transformed using the same equation used in the volcano plot (-10 x log\\(_{10}\\)) and multiplying by the “sign” of the LFC (i.e. +1 or -1).\nThe steps in producing the input required for GSEA are i) calculating and retrieving the ranking statistics ii) naming each one according to a chosen identifier (ENSEMBL or ENTREZID for example). The clusterProfiler package also includes an implementation of the GSEA algorithm (via the fgsea package), and the function works in much the same way as enrichGO from above.\n\nranked_genes &lt;- results_final %&gt;% \n  mutate(Score = sign(log2FoldChange)*-log10(padj)) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(Score)) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(Score))\n  \ngeneList &lt;- pull(ranked_genes, Score)\nnames(geneList) &lt;- pull(ranked_genes, ENSEMBL)\n  \ngse_GO  &lt;- gseGO(geneList = geneList,\n        OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db,\n        ont = \"BP\",keyType = \"ENSEMBL\")\n\nThe results may not necessarily be the same as the over-representation analysis, since GSEA is answering a slightly different question.\n\ngse_GO %&gt;% as.data.frame %&gt;% \n  slice_head(n = 10) %&gt;% \n  ## don't show the core enrichment to make a display a bit cleaner\n  select(-core_enrichment)\n\n                   ID                                          Description\nGO:1990266 GO:1990266                                 neutrophil migration\nGO:0032103 GO:0032103 positive regulation of response to external stimulus\nGO:1902622 GO:1902622                   regulation of neutrophil migration\nGO:0030593 GO:0030593                                neutrophil chemotaxis\nGO:0006066 GO:0006066                            alcohol metabolic process\nGO:0010562 GO:0010562  positive regulation of phosphorus metabolic process\nGO:0045937 GO:0045937   positive regulation of phosphate metabolic process\nGO:0006959 GO:0006959                              humoral immune response\nGO:0006956 GO:0006956                                complement activation\nGO:0006809 GO:0006809                    nitric oxide biosynthetic process\n           setSize enrichmentScore       NES       pvalue    p.adjust\nGO:1990266      67      -0.8447447 -1.854904 6.769307e-07 0.003719734\nGO:0032103     470      -0.6030969 -1.595928 3.442876e-06 0.009459301\nGO:1902622      36      -0.8936258 -1.806944 1.011179e-05 0.010266296\nGO:0030593      48      -0.8582870 -1.804620 7.208095e-06 0.010266296\nGO:0006066     265      -0.6470992 -1.630672 1.140449e-05 0.010266296\nGO:0010562     377      -0.6156663 -1.596903 1.307808e-05 0.010266296\nGO:0045937     377      -0.6156663 -1.596903 1.307808e-05 0.010266296\nGO:0006959     114      -0.7497180 -1.752118 2.433335e-05 0.016713970\nGO:0006956      25      -0.9207703 -1.764098 2.858334e-05 0.017451718\nGO:0006809      62      -0.8040712 -1.750708 4.250038e-05 0.021230871\n                qvalue rank                   leading_edge\nGO:1990266 0.003441658  721  tags=21%, list=4%, signal=20%\nGO:0032103 0.008752153 1823 tags=20%, list=10%, signal=18%\nGO:1902622 0.009498819  721  tags=22%, list=4%, signal=21%\nGO:0030593 0.009498819  323  tags=21%, list=2%, signal=21%\nGO:0006066 0.009498819 1365  tags=18%, list=8%, signal=17%\nGO:0010562 0.009498819 1432  tags=23%, list=8%, signal=21%\nGO:0045937 0.009498819 1432  tags=23%, list=8%, signal=21%\nGO:0006959 0.015464485 1411  tags=29%, list=8%, signal=27%\nGO:0006956 0.016147081  704  tags=56%, list=4%, signal=54%\nGO:0006809 0.019643715  655  tags=29%, list=4%, signal=28%\n\n\nAs GSEA uses all of the genes that were present in the dataset, it has also used all genes in a pathway to calculate the enrichment. However, to narrow-down the interpretation of a pathways the core enrichment or leading edge of a GSEA can be used.

The line is a running sum statistic that measures the degree of enrichment. It starts at zero and increases every time a gene belonging to the pathway is encountered in the ranked list, whereas it slightly decreases when a gene not in the pathway is encountered. The peak of this curve is the maximum Enrichment Score (\\(\\text{ES}\\)). If the peak is on the left (positive), the pathway is up-regulated; if the peak is on the right (negative), the pathway is down-regulated. \\(\\text{GSEA}\\)\nThe black vertical lines beneath the curve are the pathway “barcode”. Each line represents a single gene from the pathway, placed at its exact ranked position. The clustering of these ticks—either on the far left or far right—provides the visual evidence for the calculated \\(\\text{ES}\\).\nThe Bottom Panel displays the value of the statistic used to rank all genes. This confirms that the genes on the far left of the plot have the most positive values (high \\(\\text{LFC}\\)) and those on the far right have the most negative values (low \\(\\text{LFC}\\)), providing context for the directional enrichment observed in the top panel.\nIn the example plot there is a high concentration of vertical black lines to the right of the plot - coinciding with the lowest point of the green line. This is where the majority of genes for this pathway can be found in the ranked gene list, and therefore we conclude there is a tendency for genes in this pathway to be DE."

    "text": "Which database to use?\nWe have looked the two main types of test supported by clusterProfiler using a database of Gene Ontology (GO) terms as a reference. These were implemented in the enrichGO and gseGO functions respectively. The above exercise used KEGG instead. A nice feature of clusterProfiler is that you can test different databases for significant pathways with few changes to your code. Some of the different databases and the corresponding function to use are summarised below\n\nSummary of different databases that clusterProfiler can use\n\n\nDatabase\nFunction\nPrimary Focus\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nGene Ontology (GO)\n\n`enrichGO`\n`gseGO`\n\nBiological Process (BP), Molecular Function (MF), Cellular Component (CC)\n\nBroadest Coverage: Covers nearly all known genes in most species.\nHierarchical: Allows for semantic similarity grouping (simplify()).\n\n\nHigh Redundancy: Similar terms often overlap significantly.\nFunctional Ambiguity: Terms can be very broad.\n\n\n\nKEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)\n\n`enrichKEGG`\n`gseKEGG`\n\nMetabolic & Regulatory Pathways\n\nVisual Maps: Provides detailed, manually drawn pathway diagrams.\nFocus on Mechanism: Excellent for examining core signaling and metabolic processes\n\n\nLimited Coverage: Focused primarily on well-studied pathways.\nLicensing/Updates: Access can be restricted/less frequently updated in free versions.\n\n\n\nReactome\n\nenrichPathway\n`gsePathway`\n\nMolecular Events & Reactions\n\nMechanistic Detail: Highly curated, evidence-based sequence of molecular events (reactions)\nNon-Redundant Structure: Less overlap between main pathways than in GO.\n\n\nBias toward Human: Predominantly focused on human biology.\nPathway Fragmentation: High detail can make pathways appear fragmented.\n\n\n\nWikiPathways\n\nenrichWP\ngseWP\n\nCommunity-Driven, Open Content\n\nFlexible & Collaborative: Allows any researcher to create, edit, and contribute.\nRapid Inclusion: Quickly integrates novel and species-specific pathways.\n\n\nVariable Quality: Quality control is less stringent than curated databases.\nInconsistent Scope: Pathway scale and definition can be less uniform.\n\n\n\nDisease Ontology\n\nenrichDO\ngseDO\n\nStructured Vocabulary for Human Diseases\n\nHierarchical Structure: DAG allows for GSEA and semantic clustering.\nStandardized: Provides a single, clear terminology for classifying diseases.\n\n\nGene Association Reliability: Associations are aggregated from multiple sources, meaning reliability can vary.\nRedundancy: Hierarchical terms mean high-level parent terms can obscure specific results.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, you will have to decide which database(s) are more appropriate for the interpretation of your results."

Furthermore, they increase the number of statistical tests performed, leading to a higher risk of false discoveries and reduced power to detect truly differentially expressed genes.\nTo mitigate these issues, we should filter out genes with insufficient read counts before proceeding with further analysis. This can be achieved using the keep_abundant or identify_abundant functions within the tidybulk package. These functions leverage the filterByExpr function from the edgeR package (Law et al., 2016), which effectively identifies genes with adequate read counts for reliable differential expression analysis. By default, this filter retains genes with at least 10 counts in a minimum number of samples, typically set to the size of the smallest group in the experimental design.\n\ncounts_filtered &lt;- caf_tidy %&gt;% keep_abundant(factor_of_interest=condition)"

    "text": "Scaling counts to normalise\nTo account for variations in sequencing depth and library composition across samples, we perform count scaling, often referred to as normalization. This process aims to remove systematic biases that do not reflect true biological differences.\nWithin the tidybulk package, the scale_abundance function generates scaled counts. Scaling factors are calculated based on abundant (filtered) transcripts and then applied to all transcripts.\nWe can select from various normalization methods. In this analysis, we will utilize the default method: trimmed mean of M values (TMM) as implemented in the edgeR package (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010).\nIt’s important to note that TMM normalization, like most scaling methods, scales the counts relative to a single reference sample\n\ncounts_scaled &lt;- counts_filtered %&gt;% scale_abundance()"

I’m only showing the first few here.\n\nlibrary(TCGAbiolinks)\n# Retrieve the full list of projects\nall_gdc_projects &lt;- getGDCprojects()\n\n# View the result\n# The output is typically a data frame or tibble\nall_gdc_projects |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(id, name) |&gt;\n  head(n = 5)\n\n           id                                                           name\n1 CTSP-DLBCL1         CTSP Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) CALGB 50303\n2   TCGA-BRCA                                      Breast Invasive Carcinoma\n3   TCGA-LUAD                                            Lung Adenocarcinoma\n4     CPTAC-3     CPTAC-Brain, Head and Neck, Kidney, Lung, Pancreas, Uterus\n5 APOLLO-LUAD APOLLO1: Proteogenomic characterization of lung adenocarcinoma\n\n\nTo see all the data interactively within RStudio you can use the View function.\n\nall_gdc_projects |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(id, name) |&gt; View()\n\nWhat data are available for breast cancer?\n\ngetProjectSummary(\"TCGA-BRCA\")\n\n$file_count\n[1] 70776\n\n$data_categories\n   file_count case_count                data_category\n1       21134       1098  Simple Nucleotide Variation\n2        9282       1098             Sequencing Reads\n3        5317       1098                  Biospecimen\n4        2288       1098                     Clinical\n5       14346       1098        Copy Number Variation\n6        4876       1097      Transcriptome Profiling\n7        3714       1097              DNA Methylation\n8         919        881           Proteome Profiling\n9        3128        927 Somatic Structural Variation\n10       5772       1098         Structural Variation\n\n$case_count\n[1] 1098\n\n$file_size\n[1] 6.249966e+14\n\n\nWe’ll first obtain some clinical information for the TCGA breast cancer samples. The function we will eventually use to download counts will give us some information about the samples, but not everything we would want. For example, in my initial development of these materials I noticed the Estrogen Receptor (ER) status was missing which is a vital clinical indicator variable. For analyses that use site-specific characteristis (e.g. breast in this case), this kind of clinical information is more useful. Detailed clinical information can be downloaded with the following command:-\n\nproject “TCGA-BRCA” specifies the cancer cohort and must match one of the IDs returned by getGDCprojects\ndata.category “Clinical” specifies the type of data. In this case information about the patients and their disease.\ndata.type “Clinical Supplement” specifies a subset of clinical data: This often points to highly detailed or manually curated clinical record\ndata.format “BCR Biotab” files are comprehensive, non-standardized tables created by the Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) and can be converted into a data frame for manipulation in R.\n\n\nquery &lt;- GDCquery(project = \"TCGA-BRCA\",\n                  data.category = \"Clinical\",\n                  data.type = \"Clinical Supplement\",\n                  data.format = \"BCR Biotab\")\n\nThe function we have used only get the download ready and doesn’t actually fetch any data. To actually download the data we need GDCdownload.\n\nGDCdownload(query)\n\nThis downloads the raw files to our computer. If we want the data in a usable form in R we have to use a final function GDCprepare. In this case it gives a list of data frames. Functions such as head and colnames could be used to inspect the contents of each (I’m using the base lapply as I don’t want to get into purrrin this particular tutorial). I’m looking for something about ER status and it looks like the best bet is clinical_patient_brca. We will save this as a data frame for use later.\nN.B. I’m not showing the output as it’s quite lengthy.\n\nlibrary(TCGAbiolinks)\nclinical.all &lt;- GDCprepare(query)\nlapply(clinical.all, head)\nlapply(clinical.all, colnames)\n## tidyverse equivlent\n## purrr::map(clinical.all, head)\n\ntcga_brca.clin &lt;- clinical.all$clinical_patient_brca\nreadr::write_tsv(tcga_brca.clin, \"tcga_brca.clin.tsv\")\n\nTo get the transcriptomic data we are going to follow a similar approach using the GDCquery, GDCdownload and GDCprepare functions. This will take a lot longer depending on your network connection. The output of GDCprepare in this case is a SummarizedExperiment object which is a standard data type for RNA-seq. As a final step in the code I save the SummarizedExperiment to disk and check if this file exists before starting. This makes sure I don’t repeat the lengthy download.\nFor my transcriptomic data I am choosing the STAR - Counts option and requesting tumours only (TCGA also holds data for “normal”/healthy tissue). If repeating these steps on a different disease you may need to change these options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in other types of data (Proteome, Methylation, Exome,…) the general procedure is the same as presented here, but the values for workflow.type and data.type will need to be different. The TCGAbiolinks webpage has many examples of downloading data of different types.\n\n\nTCGAbiolinks will make use of a temporary folder to download file to. I noticed that on my Windows laptop the names of these temporary folders were extremely long and Windows seems to have a limit on a file name. Hence in the following code it will make use of a specific temporary folder. Otherwise on Mac or Unix it will download to your working directory.\n\n# 1.

This is the closest representation of the true number of RNA fragments sequenced for that gene. If our main priority was for differential expression (DE), we would choose these values. However, we will prefer the fpkm_uq_unstrand as these are better suited for cohort-level visualisation. The data have already undergone some normalisation make values comparable across samples. The “FPKM” stands for the standard normalisation of sequencing depth (per millions reaads) and gene length, whereas UQ means “Upper-Quartile” scaling to reduce the influence of extreme outliers.\nWe’ll create a new SummarizedExperiment object from scratch that will hold just these data. We can also take the opportunity to join the sample information included with the SummarizedExperiment as standard, with the data we queried.\n\ntcga_brca.clin &lt;- readr::read_tsv(\"tcga_brca.clin.tsv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nfpkm_uq_assay &lt;- assay(brca.data_full, \"fpkm_uq_unstrand\")\n\n# get the rowData (gene information) and colData (sample information)\n# These components are used directly from the original object\ngene_info &lt;- rowData(brca.data_full)\nsample_info &lt;- colData(brca.data_full) |&gt;\n  data.frame() |&gt;\n  dplyr::left_join(tcga_brca.clin, by = c(\"patient\"=\"bcr_patient_barcode\"))\n \n# create a new SummarizedExperiment object\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand &lt;- SummarizedExperiment(\n  assays = SimpleList(fpkm_uq = fpkm_uq_assay),\n  rowData = gene_info,\n  colData = sample_info\n)\n\n## print the output to check\n\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand\n\nclass: SummarizedExperiment \ndim: 60660 1111 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(1): fpkm_uq\nrownames(60660): ENSG00000000003.15 ENSG00000000005.6 ...\n  ENSG00000288674.1 ENSG00000288675.1\nrowData names(10): source type ... hgnc_id havana_gene\ncolnames(1111): TCGA-EW-A2FS-01A-11R-A17B-07\n  TCGA-OL-A6VR-01A-32R-A33J-07 ...

    "text": "Reducing the amount of data\nWe are not going to be running any machine learning methods or visualisation on the data we have now. More than anything else, it would take far too long to run and require huge amounts of compute resource. The data consists of 60660 “genes” and 1111 samples. Considering the genes first of all, not all of them are going to be informative and will only contribute noise to our data making any machine learning more complicated. In a previous post I introduced the tidybulk package for dealing with RNA-seq in a manner consistent with the tidyverse framework in R.\n\nlibrary(tidybulk)\n\nThe package I will be eventually using (SPOILER ALERT:tidymodels) has some pre-processing steps for removing uninformative features that are usually recommended. However, I am going to revert to some domain knowledge and use some functionality from tidybulk which are specifically developed for RNA-seq. First of all, we can remove genes that are lowly-expressed using the keep_abundant function. I played around with the settings for keep_abundant here as the defaults were a bit too aggressive. On inspecting the names of the genes retained (see commented code below) I found that PTEN and ESR1 were no longer in my data using the default, and from my knowledge of breast cancer I figure these are important.\n\n##NB using the base pipe |&gt; here as we haven't loaded tidyverse yet\n\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand_expressed &lt;- brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand |&gt;\n  keep_abundant(minimum_counts = 0.5,           # Lower the expression threshold\n    minimum_proportion = 0.025     # Lower the proportion of samples required)\n)\n\nrm(brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand)\n\n# uncomment to inspect the genes retained\n# rowData(brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand_expressed) |&gt; data.frame() |&gt; View()\n\nThe reduction in the number of genes is quite dramatic - but this is a good thing for our purposes as it will make things run quicker. The next step is to remove genes that do not have enough variability in the data. Variability is important as genes whose expression level stays the same across samples are not going to be very informative for distinguishing different subtypes. However, in the following code I will keep the names of the variable genes, but not actually do the filtering yet. Conveniently, tidybulk allows the usage of the pipe (|&gt; or %&gt;%) so we don’t have to create any new variables. Explicitly creating a tidybulk object means we can use dplyr operations such as pulling the gene_name name.\n\nvar_genes &lt;- brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand_expressed |&gt;\n  keep_variable(top = 2000) |&gt;\n  tidybulk() |&gt;\n  filter(!duplicated(gene_name)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(gene_name)\n\nvar_genes[1:10]\n\n [1] \"SCGB2A2\"    \"SCGB1D2\"    \"TFF1\"       \"PIP\"        \"CPB1\"      \n [6] \"AC093001.1\" \"S100A7\"     \"CLEC3A\"     \"LTF\"        \"IGHG1\"     \n\n\nI’d like my data to be somewhat informed by biology, so will also use a set of Cancer genes.

    "text": "Some data Exploration\nBefore embarking on any machine learning (which we will tackle next time), it is worth spending some time getting familiar with your data. Armed with some domain knowledge we can run a few basic checks. If you haven’t worked with RNA-seq data in R before, it might be worth taking a look over these examples.\nWhen working on breast cancer, and coming from a purely computational background, I quickly learnt about the importance of Estrogen Receptor (ER) status and the gene that encodes the Estrogen Receptor protein ESR1. The status of a breast cancer patient is a well-established biomarker and can indicate whether the patient’s cancer is likely to respond to hormone-blocking therapies. In other words, patients that can been categorised as ER positive should have higher expression of ESR1. In this dataset ER status looks to have been investigated by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and recorded in the er_status_by_ihc. This is one of the variables present in the BCR clinical data.\nTo get the data for just ESR1 It’s actually more efficient in this case to filter the gene from the SummarizedExperiment object before calling tidybulk. I’m not sure if this is the intended workflow, but our data are so large that calling tidybulk on the entire dataset takes too much RAM in my case.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidybulk)\n\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand[rowData(brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand)$gene_name == \"ESR1\"] |&gt;\n  tidybulk() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = er_status_by_ihc, y = fpkm_uq)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew! So ESR1 expression is indeed higher in ER positive samples. The plot also highlights some discrepancy in the recording of the ER status which should be cleaned prior to analysis. For the sake of the plot we can filter out the offending entries.\n\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand[rowData(brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand)$gene_name == \"ESR1\"] %&gt;% \n  tidybulk() %&gt;% \n  filter(er_status_by_ihc %in% c(\"Positive\", \"Negative\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = er_status_by_ihc, y = fpkm_uq)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.1) + xlab(\"ER Status\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a similar vein, the gene ERBB2 should be higher in patients that are positive for Her2 staining by IHC.\n\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand[rowData(brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand)$gene_name == \"ERBB2\"] %&gt;% \n  tidybulk() %&gt;% \n  filter(her2_status_by_ihc %in% c(\"Positive\", \"Negative\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = her2_status_by_ihc, y = fpkm_uq)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter() + scale_y_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreast cancer was traditionally classified into five intrinsic subtypes, and microarray studies sought to identify genes that define these subtypes. On such 50 gene panel was derived using a prediction analysis of microarray (PAM) and hence called PAM50. The samples in the TCGA dataset have been classified using this method, and we can check the expression level of ESR1 and ERBB2 respectively.\n\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand[rowData(brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand)$gene_name %in% c(\"ESR1\",\"ERBB2\")] %&gt;% \n  tidybulk() %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50, y = fpkm_uq, fill = paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1) + \n  scale_y_log10() + \n  facet_wrap(~gene_name) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"pink\", \"darkblue\", \"lightblue\", \"yellow\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this all makes perfect sense as Luminal A and Luminal B are ER-positive groups, Basal and Her2 are ER-negative and ERBB2 should be highly expressed in the Her2 subtype.\nSo, are the Pam50 subtypes are major source of variation in our data? The tidybulk package allows us to run dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA to look at this issue. The reduce_dimensions function computes the Principal Components and these can be added to our data ready for visualisation. Normally tidybulk would require a scale_abundance step here to correct for differences in sequencing depth between samples, but since we are using values that are already normalised to some extent this is not needed on this ocassion.\n\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand |&gt;\n  reduce_dimensions(method = \"PCA\")  |&gt; \n  ## not needed here: scale_abundance() |&gt;\n  pivot_sample()  |&gt;\n  select(.sample, PC1, PC2)\n\n# A tibble: 1,111 × 3\n   .sample                         PC1    PC2\n   &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 TCGA-EW-A2FS-01A-11R-A17B-07  9.35  -8.84 \n 2 TCGA-OL-A6VR-01A-32R-A33J-07 -6.26  -4.46 \n 3 TCGA-E9-A226-01A-21R-A157-07 -8.62   4.47 \n 4 TCGA-A8-A08H-01A-21R-A00Z-07  0.362  5.87 \n 5 TCGA-D8-A27H-01A-11R-A16F-07  7.76  16.8  \n 6 TCGA-D8-A3Z6-01A-11R-A239-07 -5.76  -5.94 \n 7 TCGA-B6-A1KN-01A-11R-A13Q-07  0.728  0.144\n 8 TCGA-BH-A0DL-01A-11R-A115-07 20.8    6.48 \n 9 TCGA-A8-A09X-01A-11R-A00Z-07 13.6   -4.60 \n10 TCGA-BH-A2L8-01A-11R-A18M-07  5.41  -7.91 \n# ℹ 1,101 more rows\n\n\nIt is now straightforward to plot, and also colour according to the PAM50 subtype of each sample.\n\nbrca_fpkm_uq_unstrand |&gt; \n  reduce_dimensions(method = \"PCA\")  |&gt;\n  pivot_sample()  |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50))  |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, col = paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50 )) + \n  geom_point()  + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"pink\", \"darkblue\", \"lightblue\", \"yellow\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA heatmap of genes from the literature\nThe PCA looks pretty good, with the main separation being between basal and Luminal A/B. Furthermore, we can get from the literature the names of the genes used in the PAM50 classifier. I got these from the genefu Bioconductor package and saved as a small text file. My previous go-to package for heatmaps was pheatmap, but whilst writing this up I came across tidyHeatmap\n\ntidyHeatmap\n\nThis package works quite well with our workflow of using a “tidy” framework. It requires data in a tbl_df or tibble format, which we can create from tidybulk once we are done with pre-processing the data. Although the data we are working with are normalised, we must apply a log\\(_2\\) transformation for the purposes of visualisation. I’ve also applied some basic data cleaning\nThe tidyHeatmap function heatmap allows us to quickly add sample annotations to the plot, and since our data were using the tidy framework we have plenty of clinical variables at our fingertips. I’m choosing ER status and PAM50 classification, but you could add others such age, grade, or anything else.\n\nif(!file.exists(\"PAM50_genes.txt\")) download.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdunning/markdunning.github.com/refs/heads/master/posts/2025_11_06_tidymodels_TCGA_part1/PAM50_genes.txt\", destfile = \"PAM50_genes.txt\")\n\npam50_genes &lt;- read.table(\"PAM50_genes.txt\")[,1]\n\nlibrary(tidyHeatmap)\n\n brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand[rowData(brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand)$gene_name %in% pam50_genes,] %&gt;% \n  ## once filtered, make a \"tidy\" version\n  tidybulk() %&gt;% \n  mutate(logcount = log2(fpkm_uq + 1)) %&gt;% \n  ## get the counts, samples and genes\n  rename(ER = er_status_by_ihc, PAM50 =paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50) %&gt;%\n  as_tibble() %&gt;% \n  mutate(ER = ifelse(ER %in% c(\"Positive\", \"Negative\"), ER, NA)) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(ER), !is.na(PAM50)) %&gt;% \n  tidyHeatmap::heatmap(\n        .column = .sample,\n        .row = gene_name,\n        .value = logcount,   \n        scale = \"row\",\n        palette_value = circlize::colorRamp2(\n            seq(-5, 5, length.out = 11), \n            RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, \"RdBu\")\n        )\n    ) %&gt;% \n  annotation_tile(ER ,palette = c(\"orange\",\"purple\")) %&gt;% \n  ## I couldn't work out how to assign particular colours, so had to experiment at bit with the correct order to specify the colours in\n  annotation_tile(PAM50,palette = c(\"darkblue\", \"pink\", \"lightblue\", \"yellow\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing the data in this manner also us to see which genes look to be over- or under-expressed in certain subtypes. Eventually, we will progress to doing our own classification so it will be useful to compare to this information.\n\n\nSurvival Analysis\nFinally, a pertinent question to ask is whether the subtypes are clinically-meaningful. If we know what subtype a patient has, what can this tell us about their survival prospects? A kaplan-meier (KM) curve is a standard way to estimate and visualize the survival probability over a specified period, and can be created by the survival package and visualised using the package survminer. The curve starts at 100% (or probability 1.0) at time zero and steps down each time a patient dies. A tick mark on the curve indicates a patient who was lost to follow-up or was still alive when the data was collected (censored). These patients contribute to the probability calculation up until the time they were last observed.\nThe clinical data we have needs modifying slightly to run the analysis. In particular we need to create “Status” and “Time” columns which records if a patient is alive (0) or dead (1) at the end of the study, and the time to either death or total follow-up time. We will also remove any patients where the Time or status is missing or inaccurate. The dataset also includes some metastatic or recurrent tumours, but for the purposes of the curve we will use only “primary” samples.\n\nlibrary(survminer)\nlibrary(survival)\nclin_data_corrected &lt;- colData(brca_fpkm_uq_unstrand) %&gt;% \n  data.frame() %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(classification_of_tumor == \"primary\") %&gt;% \n  #Define Time (Coalesce death date and follow-up date)\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    # Use days_to_death if available; otherwise, use days_to_last_follow_up\n    Time = as.numeric(dplyr::coalesce(days_to_death, days_to_last_follow_up)),\n    # Define Status \n    # Event=1 (Dead), Censored=0 (Alive)\n    Status = ifelse(vital_status.x == \"Dead\", 1, 0)\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Remove rows with NA in Time, Status, or Subtype\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Time), Time &gt; 0, Status %in% c(0, 1), paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50 != \"NA\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(PAM50 = paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50)\n\nRunning the analysis and plotting can then be achieved using the survfit and ggsurvplot packages respectively. The p-value requested is the p-value for there being any difference in survival between different groups and is calculated using a log-rank test.\n\n# --- Run Survival Analysis ---\nfit &lt;- survfit(Surv(Time, Status) ~ PAM50, data = clin_data_corrected)\n\n# --- Plot ---\nggsurvplot(\n  fit, \n  data = clin_data_corrected, \n  pval = TRUE,\n  palette = c(\"red\", \"pink\", \"darkblue\", \"lightblue\", \"yellow\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty more examples on the survminer website on how to customise this further"

The tidybulk package can be used to convert this into a “tidy” format for easy manipulation with the tidyverse set of package. A tidy format is also amenable to fitting models in R, as the general format of a model is in the form y ~ x with y and x being columns some data frame. y is often referred to as the response variable and x as the predictor variable.\nIn reality we will often have more than one predictor and our analysis will try and work out the best combination of variables to predict the outcome. However, in this example we will just use the expression of the ESR1 gene to predict the response of ER status (er_status_by_ihc). Hence we create a data frame with ESR1 expression and ER status as columns.

The overall aim is to learn about the data by modeling and refine our choice of parameters using the training, and then see how this performs in a test set. The crucial part is that the training and testing datasets are kept completely separate.\nIt is possible to use the sample function from R to pick rows from our dataset, or even the slice_sample from dplyr, but the most straightforward way of splitting the data into training and testing is using the tidymodels package. We will learn lots about this package in due course. The same way that tidyverse is a collection of packages with a common philosophy for data manipulation and visualisaton, tidymodels is a ecosystem of packages for all steps of machine learning. The first task is often to split data into traiing and testing sets, which is performed by the initial_split function after loading tidymodels. During the split it is common to use the majority (say 80%) of the data for training. You can also make sure that the your outcome of interest has roughly the same proportion in training and testing. Once a split is created with initial_split you can extract the training and testing data.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n## Setting a 'seed' makes sure the results are reproducible\nset.seed(42) \ndata_split &lt;- initial_split(er_data, \n                            prop = 0.80, \n                            strata = ER)\n\n# Create the training data set\ner_train &lt;- training(data_split)\n\n# Create the testing data set\ner_test &lt;- testing(data_split)\n\nThis is not usually required, but we can inspect the first few rows of the training\n\ner_train |&gt; \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  ER        ESR1 ER_Numeric\n  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Negative 0.222          0\n2 Negative 5.03           0\n3 Negative 0.528          0\n4 Negative 5.62           0\n5 Negative 0.475          0\n6 Negative 0.221          0\n\n\nand test data\n\ner_test |&gt;\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  ER        ESR1 ER_Numeric\n  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Positive 3.21           1\n2 Positive 3.82           1\n3 Negative 0.831          0\n4 Negative 1.14           0\n5 Positive 4.84           1\n6 Positive 4.31           1\n\n\nand check that indeed the training data has around 80% of our original data\n\nnrow(er_train) / nrow(er_data)\n\n[1] 0.7990566\n\n\nand our testing data should be around 20%\n\nnrow(er_test) / nrow(er_data)\n\n[1] 0.2009434\n\n\nWe can also check the ER Positive / Negative balance in our original dataset.\n\ndplyr::count(er_data, ER) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / nrow(er_data))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  ER           n  prop\n  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Positive   818 0.772\n2 Negative   242 0.228\n\n\nand check that it is preserved in the training:-\n\ndplyr::count(er_train, ER) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / nrow(er_train))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  ER           n  prop\n  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Positive   654 0.772\n2 Negative   193 0.228\n\n\nand testing data.

    "section": "Decision Tree",
    "text": "Decision Tree\nIt is common practice to try various statistical methods on the same dataset and compare how they perform using the metrics described above. The next method we will try is that of a decision tree, which actually follows quite nicely for the example we used at the start of this section where we picked a threshold on the ESR1 expression and used that to classify. As it’s name implies, the decision tree is a way of forming rules based on threshold in the form of “if X is &gt; … then Y belongs to class A”. If is often visualised in the form of a tree. As we only have only variable (ESR1) the tree will look a bit boring, but can go grow more much more complex.\nWe use the rpart package for this, which we should already have from installing tidymodels. The code looks pretty similar to the glm from before. Briefly, the function will try different possibilities of ESR1 as potential values for the cut-off. For each cut-off, it splits the data into two classes. It then assess the “purity” of each class; in other words the % of Positive and Negative in each class. The split resulting in the most “pure” classes is chosen.\n\nlibrary(rpart)\nset.seed(42)\n# Fit the tree model\nsimple_tree_fit &lt;- rpart(\n  ER ~ ESR1,\n  data = er_train,\n  method = \"class\" # Specifies a classification tree\n)\n\nPrinting the output gives some information about the cutoffs it has determined\n\nsimple_tree_fit\n\nn= 847 \n\nnode), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob)\n      * denotes terminal node\n\n1) root 847 193 Positive (0.77213695 0.22786305)  \n  2) ESR1&gt;=2.365644 646  19 Positive (0.97058824 0.02941176) *\n  3) ESR1&lt; 2.365644 201  27 Negative (0.13432836 0.86567164) *\n\n\nIt has chosen 2.36 as it’s cutoff value, with an ESR1 value &gt; 2.36 being put into the Positive class. In total 646 samples were placed in the Positive class with 19 samples being incorrectly classified. This gives a purity measure of 97%. The Negative class is defined by ESR1 being less than 2.36 and comprises 201 samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember that the number of miss-classifications above are reported on the training data. These are intended for use in tweaking and refining our model. For true assessment of how the model performs on unseen data we need to make some predictions.\nThis is especially true for decision tree that are prone to “overfitting”. In other words they can memorize the unique quirks and noise of the training data. The \\(97.1\\%\\) purity simply means the tree found the best rule for the specific 847 samples in the training data. The goal of machine learning is generalization; to make correct predictions on data the model has never seen before. The only way to know if the rule (\\(\\text{ESR1} \\ge 2.366\\)) is truly robust is to test it on the completely separate testing data .\n\n\nTo see the tree-like nature of the model we can use the rpart.plot package.\n\n# Load the visualization package\nlibrary(rpart.plot)\n\n# Plot the tree diagram\nrpart.plot(\n  simple_tree_fit,\n  type = 4,      # Draws the full tree structure\n  extra = 101,   # Displays the class name and prediction accuracy\n  roundint = FALSE, # Keep decimal points on the split value\n  main = \"ER Status Classification by ESR1 Expression\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with the logistic regression method, we can use the predict method to make predictions from our testing data. Unlike the logistic regression though we don’t get probabilities for individual samples, only classifications.\n\n# Make class predictions on the test set\ntree_predictions &lt;- predict(\n    simple_tree_fit, \n    newdata = er_test, \n    type = \"class\"\n)\n\ntree_predictions[1:10]\n\n       1        2        3        4        5        6        7        8 \nPositive Positive Negative Negative Positive Positive Positive Positive \n       9       10 \nPositive Positive \nLevels: Positive Negative\n\n\nWe can make the confusion matrix from these predictions using the conf_mat as before.\n\nbind_cols(er_test, Predicted_class  = tree_predictions) %&gt;% \n  conf_mat(ER, Predicted_class)\n\n          Truth\nPrediction Positive Negative\n  Positive      154        2\n  Negative       10       47\n\n\nBy adopting the tidymodels framework we are able to reuse a lot of code. We can compute the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity using the class_metrics function that we already defined:-\n\nbind_cols(er_test, Predicted_class  = tree_predictions) %&gt;% \n  class_metrics(truth=ER, estimate = Predicted_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.944\n2 sensitivity binary         0.939\n3 specificity binary         0.959\n\n\nThe decision tree seems to offer very slight improvements over the logistic regression. The elephant in the room is of course that we haven’t set a very challenging task for us to accomplish. Things will get more complex as the start to add other genes as variables, or use other outcome variables (e.g. the PAM50 classes)."

    "section": "Fitting a Logistic Regression",
    "text": "Fitting a Logistic Regression\nThe curve actually represents a series of probabilities between 0 and 1 which can be used to assign to a particular point to either Positive or Negative group. If the probability is closer to 1 for a given observation then it is more likely to belong to the Positive class, and if the probability is close to 0 then it is more likely to be Negative. The definition of “close” typically means &gt; 0.5 belong to Positive but we can change this.\nSo let’s look at the code to fit such a curve using a technique called logistic regression within R. We will use the glm function that has a similar interface to the lm function we saw briefly. Setting family = binomial is required as it tells glm to fit the S-shaped curve that we need.\nNote that we use the training portion of our data, er_train to fit the model.\n\nsimple_logit_fit &lt;- glm(\n  # Formula: Outcome ~ Predictor,\n  ER_Numeric ~ ESR1, \n  data = er_train, \n  #set the \"family\" to binomial for logistic regression\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n# View the model summary\nsummary(simple_logit_fit)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = ER_Numeric ~ ESR1, family = \"binomial\", data = er_train)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Instead the coefficient for ESR1 signifies how the log-odds of being Positive increases as the level of ESR1 increase by one unit. The odds are more intuitive and these can be calculated with:-\n\nlog_odds &lt;- coef(simple_logit_fit)[2]\nodds_ratio &lt;- exp(log_odds)\nodds_ratio\n\n    ESR1 \n2.595869 \n\n\nThe odds ratio is 2.59587 meaning the increasing ESR1 expression means you are around 3 times more likely to be ER positive than negative. Now that we have built the model we can use it to make predictions given a set of ESR1. If we want to make sure our model has not been biased by any specific patterns only observed in our training data we should predict using a set of data the model has not “seen” before. This is why we split our data into training and testing sets. If we set type = response the result will be probability for each observation in the testing set.\n\ntest_probabilities &lt;- predict(\n  simple_logit_fit, \n  newdata = er_test, \n  type = \"response\" # 'response' gives probabilities\n)\ntest_probabilities[1:10]\n\n        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8 \n0.8427194 0.9157402 0.1917981 0.2893535 0.9665688 0.9455396 0.8351112 0.9872810 \n        9        10 \n0.9768193 0.9832141 \n\n\nWe can now plot the probabilities against the respective ESR1 value, which hopefully gives the S-shaped curve we are trying to fit. To convert the probabilities to a Positive or Negative label we set a threshold such as 0.5. In the below plot we also mark the predictions that are incorrect.\n\ner_test |&gt;\n  mutate(Prob = test_probabilities, `Actual Label` = ER) |&gt;\n  mutate(`Predicted Label` = ifelse(test_probabilities &gt; 0.5, \"Positive\", \"Negative\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(`Correct Prediction` = as.factor(ER == `Predicted Label`)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = ESR1, y = Prob, col = `Actual Label`, shape = `Correct Prediction`, size = `Correct Prediction`, alpha=`Correct Prediction`)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, lty = 2) + \n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(4, 16)) +\n  scale_size_manual(values = c(5,2)) + \n  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(1,0.4))"

    "text": "Evaluating the fit\nOn inspection, it looks there are fewer cases that should be Negative that have been labeled as Positive, than Positive cases labeled as Negative. Overall though, most of the predictions look correct. To formalise this and attach some metrics we can create what is called a confusion matrix. To create this we can use the yardstick package that is included as part of tidymodels.\n\nlibrary(yardstick)\ner_test %&gt;% \n  mutate(Predicted_ER = factor(ifelse(test_probabilities &gt; 0.5, \"Positive\", \"Negative\"), levels = c(\"Positive\",\"Negative\"))) %&gt;% \n  conf_mat(ER, Predicted_ER)\n\n          Truth\nPrediction Positive Negative\n  Positive      155        5\n  Negative        9       44\n\n\nThe numbers in the table have names and meanings associated with them:-\n\nTrue Negatives (TN) 44 Correctly predicted Negative\nTrue Positives (TP) 155 Correctly predicted Positive\nFalse Positives (FP) 5 Incorrectly predicted Positive when the tumor was actually Negative. Also known as Type I Error\nFalse Negatives (FN) 9 Incorrectly predicted Negative when the tumor was actually Positive. Also known as Type II Error\n\nThree common metrics for classification problems such as this are:-\n\nAccuracy = Accuracy is the total number of correct predictions divided by the total samples.\n\n\\(TP  +TN / (Total)\\) = \\(155 + 44 / 213\\) \\(\\approx\\) 93.4%\n\nSensitivity (True Positive Rate) = how well the model finds all the actual Positive cases.\n\n\\(TP  / (TP + FN)\\) = \\(155 / (155  + 9)\\) \\(\\approx\\) 94.5%\n\nSpecificity (True Negative Rate) = how well the model avoids incorrectly classifying actual Negative cases.\n\n\\(TN  / (TN + FP)\\) = \\(44 / (44  + 5)\\) \\(\\approx\\) 89.83%\n\n\nFortunately we don’t need to type all those equations by hand as the yardstick package will allow us to define a set of metrics and use these to evaluate our predictions. This package is just one of the many that comprise the tidymodels ecosystem.\n\nclass_metrics &lt;- metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity)\n\ner_test %&gt;% \n  mutate(Predicted_ER = factor(ifelse(test_probabilities &gt; 0.5, \"Positive\", \"Negative\"), levels = c(\"Positive\",\"Negative\"))) %&gt;% \n  class_metrics(truth=ER, estimate = Predicted_ER) \n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.934\n2 sensitivity binary         0.945\n3 specificity binary         0.898\n\n\nThe metrics have all been calculated on the basis of using a probability of 0.5 to classify samples as Positive or Negative. This was a fairly arbitrary choice and we could experiment with other values. To save us time, the roc_curve function will calculate the specificity and sensitivity for a range of thresholds.\n\ner_test %&gt;% \n  mutate(Prob = test_probabilities) %&gt;% \n  roc_curve(ER, Prob) %&gt;% \n  head(n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   .threshold specificity sensitivity\n        &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 -Inf            0            1    \n 2    0.00341      0            1    \n 3    0.00608      0            0.994\n 4    0.00621      0.0204       0.994\n 5    0.0104       0.0408       0.994\n 6    0.0114       0.0612       0.994\n 7    0.0139       0.0816       0.994\n 8    0.0147       0.102        0.994\n 9    0.0155       0.122        0.994\n10    0.0167       0.122        0.988\n\n\nWe can see for example setting a threshold close to 0 means that all Positive cases are identified, but the specificity is miserable as there are too many false positives. Plotting sensitivity against 1 - specificity (the False Positive rates) gives a very famous curve called the ROC curve (“Receiver Operating Characteristics”). We can create this plot using the autoplot function after using the roc_curve function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn case you were wondering where this name originates:- From wikipedia\n\nThe ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields, starting in 1941, which led to its name (“receiver operating characteristic”).\n\n\n\n\ner_test %&gt;% \n  mutate(Prob = test_probabilities) %&gt;% \n  roc_curve(ER, Prob) %&gt;% \n  autoplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA curve near the top-left corner indicates a model with high discriminatory power. i.e. the model can achieve high Sensitivity (finding true positives) without incurring a significant cost in Specificity (avoiding false positives). If the curve is close to the diagonal line then it is not much better than guessing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen deciding the threshold there is usually a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity. Do you want to make sure that you capture all your positive cases at the expense of a few false positives? In which case you would lower the threshold.\nOr do you want to be absolutely sure about the cases you identify, at the expense of missing a few positives? If so, then increase the threshold.\nIf a treatment following a positive diagnosis is invasive, expensive, or has severe side effects, you want to be highly certain before proceeding. Here, the cost of a False Positive (treating a healthy person) might be much higher than the cost of a False Negative.\nOn the other hand you are developing a cancer screening test, which if positive would lead to further investigations, you might want to lower threshold so you don’t ignore any potential true cases at an early stage. In this scenario, the cost of a few unnecessary follow-up procedures (False Positive) is deemed acceptable compared to the devastating cost of missing an early-stage cancer (False Negative).\n\n\nThe ROC curve also leads to another diagnostic metric that can be used to assess how effective our model is at predicting. Given that we want the curve to be in the top-left, that area under the curve or AUC is an important measure. Since both axes are limited between 0 and 1 the maximum possible area is 1, and the closer to 1 we are means a better model.\n\ner_test %&gt;% \n  mutate(Prob = test_probabilities) %&gt;% \n  roc_auc(ER, Prob)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 roc_auc binary         0.964\n\n\nWe’ve now seen several metrics; accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC. Some or all of these can be used to assess our model. Furthermore they can be used to compare different types of model as they can be calculated on the results of applying other statistical methods to classify our data."

However, we have already done this using tidybulk so our recipe is very short. For other projects I suggest looking at the official documentation\n\nhttps://www.tidymodels.org/start/recipes/#recipe\n\nPreviously when using glm for logistic regression we had to use a numeric form of the variable we are trying to predict (i.e. 0 or 1 for Negative and Positive respectively). However, tidymodels prefers a factor and will perform any conversions internally if needs be.\n\n# We assume the log-transform has already been applied outside the recipe\ner_recipe &lt;- recipe(ER ~ ESR1, data = er_train) # %&gt;% \n  # step_normalize() - scale the data\n  # step_nzv - remove features with low variance.\n\n“Workflows” in tidymodels are a good idea because they are the centralised container that brings together the essential parts of the modeling process: the model definition and the data processing recipe. They ensure your work is consistent, easy to manage, and scalable. The workflow itself doesn’t contain the code to fit the model, but it contains all the instructions and objects needed for the fit() function to execute the model fitting."

    "section": "Fitting a Logistic Regression",
    "text": "Fitting a Logistic Regression\nThe curve actually represents a series of probabilities between 0 and 1 which can be used to assign to a particular point to either Positive or Negative group. If the probability is closer to 1 for a given observation then it is more likely to belong to the Positive class, and if the probability is close to 0 then it is more likely to be Negative. The definition of “close” typically means &gt; 0.5 belong to Positive but we can change this.\nSo let’s look at the code to fit such a curve using a technique called logistic regression within R. We will use the glm function that has a similar interface to the lm function we saw briefly. Setting family = binomial is required as it tells glm to fit the S-shaped curve that we need.\nNote that we use the training portion of our data, er_train to fit the model.\n\nsimple_logit_fit &lt;- glm(\n  # Formula: Outcome ~ Predictor,\n  ER_Numeric ~ ESR1, \n  data = er_train, \n  #set the \"family\" to binomial for logistic regression\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n# View the model summary\nsummary(simple_logit_fit)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = ER_Numeric ~ ESR1, family = \"binomial\", data = er_train)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Instead the coefficient for ESR1 signifies how the log-odds of being Positive increases as the level of ESR1 increase by one unit. The odds are more intuitive and these can be calculated with:-\n\nlog_odds &lt;- coef(simple_logit_fit)[2]\nodds_ratio &lt;- exp(log_odds)\nodds_ratio\n\n   ESR1 \n3.87236 \n\n\nThe odds ratio is 3.87236 meaning the increasing ESR1 expression means you are around 4 times more likely to be ER positive than negative. Now that we have built the model we can use it to make predictions given a set of ESR1. If we want to make sure our model has not been biased by any specific patterns only observed in our training data we should predict using a set of data the model has not “seen” before. This is why we split our data into training and testing sets. If we set type = response the result will be probability for each observation in the testing set.\n\ntest_probabilities &lt;- predict(\n  simple_logit_fit, \n  newdata = er_test, \n  type = \"response\" # 'response' gives probabilities\n)\ntest_probabilities[1:10]\n\n        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8 \n0.8156191 0.9108220 0.1506655 0.2125649 0.9757988 0.9515301 0.8307946 0.9932624 \n        9        10 \n0.9862456 0.9904669 \n\n\nWe can now plot the probabilities against the respective ESR1 value, which hopefully gives the S-shaped curve we are trying to fit. To convert the probabilities to a Positive or Negative label we set a threshold such as 0.5. In the below plot we also mark the predictions that are incorrect.\n\ner_test |&gt;\n  mutate(Prob = test_probabilities, `Actual Label` = ER) |&gt;\n  mutate(`Predicted Label` = ifelse(test_probabilities &gt; 0.5, \"Positive\", \"Negative\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(`Correct Prediction` = as.factor(ER == `Predicted Label`)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = ESR1, y = Prob, col = `Actual Label`, shape = `Correct Prediction`, size = `Correct Prediction`, alpha=`Correct Prediction`)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, lty = 2) + \n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(4, 16)) +\n  scale_size_manual(values = c(5,2)) + \n  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(1,0.4))"

Plotting sensitivity against 1 - specificity (the False Positive rates) gives a very famous curve called the ROC curve (“Receiver Operating Characteristics”). We can create this plot using the autoplot function after using the roc_curve function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn case you were wondering where this name originates:- From wikipedia\n\nThe ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields, starting in 1941, which led to its name (“receiver operating characteristic”).\n\n\n\n\ner_test %&gt;% \n  mutate(Prob = test_probabilities) %&gt;% \n  roc_curve(ER, Prob) %&gt;% \n  autoplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA curve near the top-left corner indicates a model with high discriminatory power. i.e. the model can achieve high Sensitivity (finding true positives) without incurring a significant cost in Specificity (avoiding false positives). If the curve is close to the diagonal line then it is not much better than guessing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen deciding the threshold there is usually a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity. Do you want to make sure that you capture all your positive cases at the expense of a few false positives? In which case you would lower the threshold.\nOr do you want to be absolutely sure about the cases you identify, at the expense of missing a few positives? If so, then increase the threshold.\nIf a treatment following a positive diagnosis is invasive, expensive, or has severe side effects, you want to be highly certain before proceeding. Here, the cost of a False Positive (treating a healthy person) might be much higher than the cost of a False Negative.\nOn the other hand you are developing a cancer screening test, which if positive would lead to further investigations, you might want to lower threshold so you don’t ignore any potential true cases at an early stage. In this scenario, the cost of a few unnecessary follow-up procedures (False Positive) is deemed acceptable compared to the devastating cost of missing an early-stage cancer (False Negative).\n\n\nThe ROC curve also leads to another diagnostic metric that can be used to assess how effective our model is at predicting. Given that we want the curve to be in the top-left, that area under the curve or AUC is an important measure. Since both axes are limited between 0 and 1 the maximum possible area is 1, and the closer to 1 we are means a better model.\n\ner_test %&gt;% \n  mutate(Prob = test_probabilities) %&gt;% \n  roc_auc(ER, Prob)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 roc_auc binary         0.964\n\n\nWe’ve now seen several metrics; accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC. Some or all of these can be used to assess our model. Furthermore they can be used to compare different types of model as they can be calculated on the results of applying other statistical methods to classify our data."

However, we have already done this using tidybulk so our recipe is very short. For other projects I suggest looking at the official documentation\n\nhttps://www.tidymodels.org/start/recipes/#recipe\n\nPreviously when using glm for logistic regression we had to use a numeric form of the variable we are trying to predict (i.e. 0 or 1 for Negative and Positive respectively). However, tidymodels prefers a factor and will perform any conversions internally if needs be.\n\n# We assume the log-transform has already been applied outside the recipe\ner_recipe &lt;- recipe(ER ~ ESR1, data = er_train) # %&gt;% \n  # step_normalize() - scale the data\n  # step_nzv - remove features with low variance.\n\n“Workflows” in tidymodels are a good idea because they are the centralised container that brings together the essential parts of the modeling process: the model definition and the data processing recipe. They ensure your work is consistent, easy to manage, and scalable. The workflow itself doesn’t contain the code to fit the model, but it contains all the instructions and objects needed for the fit() function to execute the model fitting."

    "section": "Preparing the data for Machine Learning",
    "text": "Preparing the data for Machine Learning\nThe machine learning tasks we have planned require a slightly different strategy for processing. Firstly, whist FPKM are an easy way to compare expression across different gene lengths and library sizes for visualization, it’s not a statistically robust input for advanced modeling tasks. For the most reliable and highest-performing model(s), particularly when using linear methods the input data must adhere to statistical assumptions (such as a stable variance across the whole range of counts). Furthermore, FPKM incorporates cohort-level information during calibration. A central tenent of Machine Learning is that data are dividing into training and testing sets that crucially are processed completely independently such that no information from the testing set is used during training. The cohort-level nature of FPKM violates this assumption and potentially leads to an issue called “data leakage” which could compromise the validity of our models and lead to overly-optimistic predictions.\nWe will therefore take the raw counts from TCGA as our stating point. Our approach will be to first split the data into independent training and testing sets, and then process the training data. Our testing data will be transformed using parameters learnt from the training data. Finally, we will state our intentions of modeling the Estrogen Receptor (ER) status and therefore include only samples where we have a Positive or Negative observations for this variable.\nFirst we will create a matrix of raw counts of all available samples.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(DESeq2)\n\nset.seed(42)\n\n## Load the full dataset we created previously\n\nbrca.data_full &lt;- readRDS(\"brca.data_full.rds\")\n\ntcga_brca.clin &lt;- readr::read_tsv(\"tcga_brca.clin.tsv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n# get the gene annotations stored in the full data\ngene_info &lt;- rowData(brca.data_full)\n\n## Join the sample information extra clinical variables\n## Add the barcode as rownames, which will make subsetting easier\n\nsample_info &lt;- colData(brca.data_full) |&gt;\n  data.frame() |&gt;\n  dplyr::left_join(tcga_brca.clin, by = c(\"patient\"=\"bcr_patient_barcode\")) %&gt;% \n  filter(er_status_by_ihc %in% c(\"Positive\",\"Negative\")) %&gt;% \n  tibble::column_to_rownames(\"barcode\")\n\nraw_assay &lt;- assay(brca.data_full, \"unstranded\")[,rownames(sample_info)] \nrownames(raw_assay) &lt;- gene_info$gene_name\n\nIt is possible to use the sample function from R to pick rows from our dataset, or even the slice_sample from dplyr, but the most straightforward way of splitting the data into training and testing is using the tidymodels package. We will learn lots about this package in due course. The same way that tidyverse is a collection of packages with a common philosophy for data manipulation and visualisaton, tidymodels is a ecosystem of packages for all steps of machine learning. The first task is often to split data into training and testing sets, which is performed by the initial_split function after loading tidymodels. During the split it is common to use the majority (say 80%) of the data for training. You can also make sure that the your outcome of interest has roughly the same proportion in training and testing.\nOnce a split is created with initial_split you can extract the training and testing data. We actually just want the barcodes of the training and testing sets, and we can use these to create DESeq2 objects from the raw counts.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(DESeq2)\n\nset.seed(42)\n\ndata_split &lt;- data.frame(Sample = rownames(sample_info), ER = sample_info$er_status_by_ihc) %&gt;% \n  initial_split(prop = 0.8, strata  = \"ER\")\n\ntraining_samples &lt;- training(data_split) %&gt;% pull(Sample)\ntesting_samples &lt;- testing(data_split) %&gt;% pull(Sample)\n\nbrca_training &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(raw_assay[,training_samples],\n                                        sample_info[training_samples,],\n                                        design = ~er_status_by_ihc)\n\nbrca_testing &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(raw_assay[,testing_samples],\n                                        sample_info[testing_samples,],\n                                        design = ~er_status_by_ihc)\n\nWe now perform the statistical normalization, variance stabilization, and feature selection steps, ensuring that all parameters are calculated solely from the training data before being applied consistently to both sets.\nThe DESeq2 function estimateSizeFactors() calculates a normalization factor for each sample (a column) in the training set. This accounts for differences in sequencing depth (library size). This must be calculated first, as it is needed for the subsequent steps. The estimateDispersions() function then calculates the gene-wise biological variability. Critically, it fits a function that models the relationship between a gene’s mean expression and its variance across the entire training cohort. Once estimated, this function can be added directly to the testing data to ensure both training and testing data are processed the same.\nWe convert the normalized counts to a log\\(_2\\) scale (adding the essential \\(+1\\) pseudo-count to handle zeros). This transformation helps stabilize the variance but, more importantly here, makes the variance calculation reflective of biological fold change rather than raw magnitude. We choose the Top 250 Most Variable Genes for two reasons to combat the “Curse of Dimensionality” by reducing the feature space. This step calculates the variability only on the training data, preventing “leakage”. The resulting list, most_var_genes, is the filter to be used for both sets.\nestimateSizeFactors() is run independently on the test data, which is fine because size factors are a sample-specific property (based on that sample’s own depth) and do not leak cohort information.\n\nbrca_training &lt;- estimateSizeFactors(brca_training)\nbrca_training &lt;- estimateDispersions(brca_training)\n\nnormalised_counts &lt;- log2(counts(brca_training, normalized = TRUE) + 1)\n\nmost_var_genes &lt;- rownames(normalised_counts)[order(rowVars(normalised_counts),decreasing = TRUE)[1:250]]\n\nbrca_testing &lt;- estimateSizeFactors(brca_testing)\ndispersionFunction(brca_testing) &lt;- dispersionFunction(brca_training)\n\nFinally we perform the VST step to calibrate both datasets, and then convert to a “tidy” format that we will need for machine learning.\n\nvsd_train &lt;- varianceStabilizingTransformation(brca_training, blind = FALSE)\nvsd_test &lt;- varianceStabilizingTransformation(brca_testing, blind = FALSE)\n\nbrca_train_tidy &lt;- assay(vsd_train)[most_var_genes,] %&gt;% \n  t() %&gt;% \n  data.frame() %&gt;% \n  tibble::rownames_to_column(\"barcode\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(tibble::rownames_to_column(sample_info, \"barcode\"))\n\nbrca_test_tidy &lt;- assay(vsd_test)[most_var_genes,] %&gt;% \n  t() %&gt;% \n  data.frame() %&gt;% \n  tibble::rownames_to_column(\"barcode\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(tibble::rownames_to_column(sample_info, \"barcode\"))\n\nsaveRDS(brca_train_tidy, \"brca_train_tidy.rds\")\nsaveRDS(brca_test_tidy, \"brca_test_tidy.rds\")"

    "text": "Introducing glmnet\nWith the number of features (genes) we have in our dataset, even after filtering, there is still the potential for us to suffer from the “curse of dimensionality” and overfit our data. In other words, we could build a model so specific that it is of little use beyond the dataset that it was trained upon.\nMethods that provide regularization are very appealing for this reason because they constrain the model, helping it find the optimal combination of features. One such method that implements these concepts in tidymodels is called “glmnet”.\nThe amount to which the contribution of less-informative features is “shrunk” is controlled by two arguments: penalty (known as \\(\\mathbf{\\lambda}\\) in the literature) and mixture (known as \\(\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\)). \\(\\mathbf{\\lambda}\\) is a single, non-negative numerical value that controls the strength of the regularization (shrinkage) applied to the model. If \\(\\mathbf{\\lambda = 0}\\), no penalty is applied, and the model reverts to standard, unregularized Logistic Regression. If \\(\\mathbf{\\lambda &gt; 0}\\), coefficients are shrunk towards zero to prevent overfitting.\n\\(\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\) controls how the features are shrunk and defines the characteristics of the resulting model, ranging between 0 and 1. Lasso (\\(\\mathbf{\\alpha = 1}\\)) forces the coefficients of less important genes exactly to zero, resulting in a sparse model (automatic feature selection). Ridge (\\(\\mathbf{\\alpha = 0}\\)) shrinks all coefficients towards zero but never removes any gene completely. Any value between \\(\\mathbf{0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1}\\) is known as the Elastic Net penalty. This blend ensures the model benefits from Lasso’s feature selection while retaining the stability that Ridge provides when dealing with highly correlated features (a common characteristic in RNA-seq data).\nValues such as these, that can take a range of values and affect the fitting of the model, are known as Hyperparameters. This is a distinct concept from a parameter, which is a quantity that is estimated during the model fit, such as the coefficients (\\(\\beta\\) values) of a regression model.\nWe will pick some values of penalty and mixture to see how the model works. In practice, we would want to use a range of values and tune our model to find the best combination, which will be a topic for another time though.\nAs with other models we have used, the first stage is to create a model specification.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nlasso_spec_fixed &lt;- logistic_reg(\n  penalty = 0.01,  # Fixed penalty (lambda)\n  mixture = 1 # set alpha = 1 for lasso      \n) %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"glmnet\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"classification\")\n\nAs before we are using data that have already been processed using domain-specific tools, so there is no need for much in our “recipe” (sometimes you will see steps to remove features with zero or small variances for example). However, we need to change the formula from using a single gene to predict to using all available features. The syntax for this is ER ~., which avoids having to type all the feature names.\nWe also need to introduce a step that will normalize (or standardise) our features (genes) by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. In other words to create a “z-score” that will make all the features comparable and stop any one feature from dominating the model or obscuring the contribution from other features. Features with a higher mean or variance could also be unfairly shrunken by lasso.\n\ner_recipe_multigene &lt;- recipe(ER ~ ., data = er_train)  %&gt;% \n  step_normalize(all_predictors())\n\nWe now combine the recipe and specification into a workflow and fitting the model to the train data should hopefully follow a familiar pattern:-\n\n# Define the workflow using the fixed specification and your multi-gene recipe\nlasso_workflow_fixed &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_model(lasso_spec_fixed) %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(er_recipe_multigene)\n\n# Fit the model directly to your training data\nfixed_lasso_fit &lt;- lasso_workflow_fixed %&gt;%\n  fit(data = er_train)\n\nPrinting the model gives us some insight into the modeling process. After printing the recipe and model specification, we see how the model is learning from the data.\n\nLambda (\\(\\lambda\\)) “Penalty Strength”. This is the \\(\\lambda\\) value applied at that specific step. It decreases as you move down the table.\nDf (Degrees of Freedom) This is the count of genes whose coefficients are non-zero at that \\(\\lambda\\) value.\n%Dev (% Deviance Explained) - Model Fit on Training Data. This is the percentage of deviance (a measure of error, similar to \\(R^2\\)) that is explained by the model. A higher value is better.\n\n\nfixed_lasso_fit\n\n══ Workflow [trained] ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: logistic_reg()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1 Recipe Step\n\n• step_normalize()\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCall:  glmnet::glmnet(x = maybe_matrix(x), y = y, family = \"binomial\",      alpha = ~1) \n\n     Df  %Dev   Lambda\n1     0  0.00 0.274900\n2     1  6.70 0.250500\n3     3 13.88 0.228300\n4     5 20.31 0.208000\n5     6 25.83 0.189500\n6     6 30.60 0.172700\n7     6 34.67 0.157300\n8     8 38.26 0.143400\n9     8 41.51 0.130600\n10    8 44.33 0.119000\n11    8 46.78 0.108400\n12    9 48.95 0.098810\n13    9 50.94 0.090030\n14    9 52.69 0.082030\n15    9 54.24 0.074740\n16   12 55.71 0.068100\n17   15 57.09 0.062050\n18   15 58.34 0.056540\n19   15 59.45 0.051520\n20   16 60.50 0.046940\n21   16 61.44 0.042770\n22   19 62.32 0.038970\n23   21 63.17 0.035510\n24   21 63.96 0.032350\n25   22 64.67 0.029480\n26   25 65.31 0.026860\n27   25 65.94 0.024480\n28   26 66.52 0.022300\n29   26 67.06 0.020320\n30   26 67.57 0.018510\n31   27 68.17 0.016870\n32   30 68.76 0.015370\n33   36 69.37 0.014010\n34   36 70.00 0.012760\n35   44 70.64 0.011630\n36   47 71.47 0.010590\n37   51 72.36 0.009654\n38   57 73.25 0.008796\n39   63 74.13 0.008015\n40   63 75.03 0.007303\n41   64 75.83 0.006654\n42   67 76.63 0.006063\n43   71 77.55 0.005524\n44   73 78.48 0.005033\n45   78 79.45 0.004586\n46   86 80.46 0.004179\n\n...\nand 54 more lines.\n\n\nEven though we have told the model what value of \\(\\lambda\\) we want to use, it is trying out different values of \\(\\lambda\\) and assessing the model fit at each point. In practical terms, this would allow us to tune the behaviour of the model but that is beyond the scope of this particular section and shouldn’t be performed directly on the training data. By printing the coefficients of the model we can see what genes it has “shrunken” to zero and effectively discarded from the model.\n\ntidy(fixed_lasso_fit) %&gt;% arrange(estimate)\n\n# A tibble: 246 × 3\n   term     estimate penalty\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 IGLV6.57  -0.295     0.01\n 2 KLK5      -0.272     0.01\n 3 KIF1A     -0.215     0.01\n 4 KRT4      -0.206     0.01\n 5 GSTM1     -0.199     0.01\n 6 ZIC1      -0.146     0.01\n 7 ACTL8     -0.136     0.01\n 8 FABP7     -0.130     0.01\n 9 DLK1      -0.0998    0.01\n10 KRT81     -0.0949    0.01\n# ℹ 236 more rows\n\n\nThis can also be shown on a plot.

The tidymodels eco-system uses yardstick to efficiently compile metrics and we will use accuracy, specificity and sensitivity as defined in the previous section.\n\nclass_metrics &lt;- metric_set(accuracy, specificity, sensitivity)\n\nfixed_lasso_fit |&gt;\n  predict(new_data = er_test) |&gt;\n  bind_cols(er_test) |&gt;\n  class_metrics(truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.920\n2 specificity binary         0.939\n3 sensitivity binary         0.857\n\n\nOverall the model is doing quite well even though we didn’t use ESR1. The specificity is quite high, meaning that it doesn’t pick too many false positives. On the other hand, the lower sensitivity means that some samples that are truly Positive are being missed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical context\n\n\n\nIn a clinical context, the high specificity is encouraging as you wouldn’t progress too many patients to potentially aggressive treatment they wouldn’t benefit from. On the other hand, some patients may miss the opportunity to take a potentially life-changing or life-extending treatment.\n\n\nThere is clearly an opportunity for some improvement, and that could be achieved by better choice of hyper-parameters. For now though lets see how other methods perform starting with the decision tree."

Although TFF1 is strongly correlated with ER status, it is not powerful enough to separate the classes cleanly on its own.\nFurthermore, unlike the initial ESR1-based tree (seen in the previous section), this tree is very deep and involves splits on numerous secondary genes (GRPR, KIF1A, YP2B7P, HOTAIR, etc.). The model is relying on the cumulative effect of many weak, complex, and potentially non-linear interactions among many genes to achieve classification. There is a danger that we might be over-fitting.\nNevertheless, we can see how the model performs:-\n\ndecision_tree_fit |&gt;\n  predict(new_data = er_test) |&gt;\n  bind_cols(er_test) |&gt;\n  class_metrics(truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.901\n2 specificity binary         0.927\n3 sensitivity binary         0.816\n\n\nThe specificity is roughly the same as our Lasso from above, but the sensitivity is worse still. It seems like it is about time to introduce a method that is an evolution from the Decision Tree - that of a Random Forest."

    "text": "Introducing the Random Forest\nThe random forest is a natural extension of a decision tree, as it harnesses the power of many different decision tree and uses the predictions from each individual tree to form a consensus or majority vote for each sample to be classified.\nThe method constructs many decision trees (as above), each using a “bootstrap sample” (a random sample with replacement) of the data. Therefore, each tree is a bit different and makes its own predictions without relying on others. Moreover, when tree is built it doesn’t look at all the features (genes in our case) at once. It picks a few at random to decide how to split the data. Whilst some trees might not work very well individually, the crowd-voting step of taking predictions from a large number of trees should lead to accurate predictions overall and negate concerns over individual trees overfitting data.\nIt’s specification is similar to models we have used before. We can set ranger as the method used to build the model, and this package is included as part of tidymodels. Setting importance = \"permutation\" is useful for biological interpretation as it will allow us to see which features (genes) are contributing most to the model. An arbitrary value of 1000 trees is being used, and in practice we would seek to find the optimal value (which we will discuss at a later point).\n\nrandom_forest_spec &lt;- rand_forest(\n    mode = \"classification\", \n    trees = 1000 # Using 1000 trees for robustness\n  ) %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"ranger\", importance = \"permutation\")\n\nDue to the random nature of the method, we need to set a seed to ensure reproducibility before we conduct the fit\n\nset.seed(42)\n\nrandom_forest_workflow &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_model(random_forest_spec) %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(er_recipe_multigene)\n\nrandom_forest_fit &lt;- random_forest_workflow %&gt;%\n  fit(data = er_train)\n\nrandom_forest_fit\n\n══ Workflow [trained] ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: rand_forest()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1 Recipe Step\n\n• step_normalize()\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRanger result\n\nCall:\n ranger::ranger(x = maybe_data_frame(x), y = y, num.trees = ~1000,      importance = ~\"permutation\", num.threads = 1, verbose = FALSE,      seed = sample.int(10^5, 1), probability = TRUE) \n\nType:                             Probability estimation \nNumber of trees:                  1000 \nSample size:                      847 \nNumber of independent variables:  245 \nMtry:                             15 \nTarget node size:                 10 \nVariable importance mode:         permutation \nSplitrule:                        gini \nOOB prediction error (Brier s.):  0.05419088 \n\n\nWhilst the decision tree was quite intuitive to visualise, the random forest is unfortunately less so. But let’s make some predictions and see how it performs:-\n\nrandom_forest_fit %&gt;% \n  predict(new_data = er_test) |&gt;\n  bind_cols(er_test) |&gt;\n  class_metrics(truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.925\n2 specificity binary         0.933\n3 sensitivity binary         0.898\n\n\nSo the sensitivity has improved from the decision tree, and also beats the glmnet model, with no difference in specificity. As with the Lasso output, we can get a sense of what features are most powerful using an “importance” score that is calculated (setting importance = \"permutation\" in the specification allows us to do this). The ranking of these scores is important, and reflects how much more or how much less this gene contributes compared to all others in your model. A positive score means a model benefits from having that gene includes, whereas a negative score means the gene actually makes a model perform worse.\nExtracting this information can be done as follows. We see that TFF1 is the most important which connects with the decision tree we built above.\n\nimportance_df &lt;- pull_workflow_fit(random_forest_fit)$fit$variable.importance %&gt;%\n  enframe(name = \"term\", value = \"Importance\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Importance))\nimportance_df\n\n# A tibble: 245 × 2\n   term       Importance\n   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 TFF1          0.00825\n 2 SERPINA11     0.00821\n 3 POTEKP        0.00801\n 4 CYP2B7P       0.00683\n 5 LINC01087     0.00666\n 6 AC044784.1    0.00600\n 7 HORMAD1       0.00521\n 8 GP2           0.00518\n 9 SRARP         0.00508\n10 LINC01016     0.00505\n# ℹ 235 more rows\n\n\nThe genes with negative “importance” are in fact only very slightly so, and there only a handful of them. Moreover, we can combine these importance metrics with the Lasso output from above to compare how the two methods are considering genes as important.

    "text": "Summary\nIn this section, we built powerful classification models by taking advantage of many gene features while aiming to prevent overfitting. We employed two fundamentally different approaches:\n\nThe Lasso approach (using glmnet), which identifies features with a strong linear relationship to the outcome by driving the coefficients of less useful features to zero.\nThe Random Forest, which builds a consensus prediction from many random decision trees, allowing it to capture complex, non-linear interactions and threshold effects.\n\nWhilst both these methods achieved good performance and provided complementary insights into gene importance, they typically need some tuning to discover the best ‘hyper-parameters.’ This will be discussed in a later part. Before that, in Part 3b, we will explore some other classification methods, like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and learn how to incorporate other types of predictors (such as clinical variables like age and tumor grade) into our models."

    "text": "K- Nearest Neighbours (KNN)\nThe KNN method is fairly intuitive to understand in a two-dimensional space (i.e. when using two features for prediction), so we will pick two genes for illustrative purposes to predict ER status. The first is our favourite ESR1 followed by TFF1 which we saw gave good predictions.\n\ner_train_simple &lt;- dplyr::select(brca_train_tidy, ER  = er_status_by_ihc, ESR1, TFF1) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(ER  = forcats::fct_rev(ER))\n\ner_test_simple &lt;- dplyr::select(brca_test_tidy, ER  = er_status_by_ihc, ESR1, TFF1) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(ER  = forcats::fct_rev(ER))\n\n\nIntuition\nWe can start by plotting ESR1 against TFF1 and colouring according the ER status of each patient. These genes have been chosen deliberately to give separation into ER classes. i.e. higher ESR1 and TFF1 for a patient generally means and ER positive tumour.\n\nggplot(er_train_simple, aes(x = ESR1, y = TFF1, col = ER)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main goal of machine learning is to try and make predictions on unseen data given the information in our training dataset. So let’s consider the first such sample in our test dataset. We will ignore the existing ER classification for this sample for now.\n\nnew_sample &lt;- er_test_simple |&gt;\n  slice_head() |&gt;\n  select(-ER)\nnew_sample\n\n      ESR1     TFF1\n1 12.53109 7.824957\n\n\nIn order to decide what ER status this sample we might be we can simply plot it on the same axes as our training data.\n\nggplot(er_train_simple, aes(x = ESR1, y = TFF1, col = ER)) + geom_point() + geom_point(data=(new_sample), col=\"black\", size=3, stroke = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like most of the training set points surrounding our new sample are Positive, therefore it makes sense to declare the new sample as Positive too. This is essentially how KNN works. It determines the “k” nearest points in the training set closest to the point to be classified and takes the majority of the classifications of the closest points.\nA typical starting point is k = 5 and finding the five closest point can be achieved by calculating the difference of each observation in training data to our new sample. The distance is this case is the “euclidean” distance - that is the square root of the sum of the difference from each ESR1 and TFF1 from the new observation. All distances are then ordered from largest to smallest. The code is given below for a k of 5 but feel free to experiment with different values!\n\n### Set k to 5  but change it if you like to see how the plot alters\nk &lt;- 5\n\nnearest_training_samples &lt;- er_train_simple |&gt;\n  mutate(distance = sqrt((ESR1 - new_sample$ESR1)^2 + (TFF1 - new_sample$TFF1)^2)) |&gt;\n  arrange(distance) |&gt;\n  slice_min(distance, n = k)\n\n\nggplot(er_train_simple, aes(x = ESR1, y = TFF1, col = ER)) + geom_point() + \n  geom_point(data=(new_sample),col=\"black\", size=3, stroke = 2) +\n  geom_point(data=(nearest_training_samples), shape =4,col=\"steelblue\", size=4, stroke = 2,alpha=0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe method would now look at the ER label of the nearest points and calculates a proportion of Positive cases. In this instances the proportion is 1 which exceeded a default threshold of 0.5 so the new point is classified as Positive.\nNow let’s look at a more difficult example:-\n\n\n      ESR1     TFF1\n1 10.84516 3.823104\n\n\nWhen we plot this on the plot it seems to fall within a grey area between Positive and Negative cases\n\nk &lt;- 5\n\nnearest_training_samples &lt;- er_train_simple |&gt;\n  mutate(distance = sqrt((ESR1 - edge_case$ESR1)^2 + (TFF1 - edge_case$TFF1)^2)) |&gt;\n  arrange(distance) |&gt;\n  slice_min(distance, n = k)\n\n\nggplot(er_train_simple, aes(x = ESR1, y = TFF1, col = ER)) + geom_point() + \n  geom_point(data=(edge_case), size = 3,col=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=(nearest_training_samples), shape =4,col=\"steelblue\", size=4,stroke=2,alpha=0.6) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, two of the five nearest samples are Positive so the predicted probability of Positive would be \\(2/5 = 0.4\\). Since this does not exceed a threshold of 0.5 (which can be changed if we want) the sample would get a Negative class.\n\nnearest_training_samples\n\n        ER     ESR1     TFF1  distance\n1 Positive 10.93302 3.995238 0.1932608\n2 Negative 10.50824 3.529232 0.4470735\n3 Negative 10.69983 3.375647 0.4704659\n4 Negative 10.16436 3.656525 0.7008745\n5 Positive 11.25317 4.462201 0.7582332\n\n\nNow we have a feeling for the method lets create a KNN model in tidymodels. This follows a hopefully familiar pattern starting with the model specification. The kknn package is the default engine for nearest neighbour classification.\nThere are actually various methods for calculating the class probabilities rather than the majority vote described above. To use this scheme, we set the weight_func argument to nearest_neighbour function to rectangular.\n\n## Create a specification\nknn_spec &lt;- \n  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 5, weight_func =  \"rectangular\") |&gt; \n  ## a rectangular function is the majority vote discussed here\n  set_mode(\"classification\") |&gt;\n  set_engine(\"kknn\")\n\nWe now put everything together.\n\n## Make the recipe to predict ER from ESR1 and TFF1\n\ner_recipe_simple &lt;- recipe(ER ~ ESR1 + TFF1, data = er_train_simple) %&gt;% \n  step_normalize(all_predictors())\n\n## Construct the workflow\n\nknn_workflow &lt;- \n  workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(er_recipe_simple) %&gt;% \n  add_model(knn_spec)\n\nknn_fit &lt;- fit(knn_workflow, data = er_train_simple)\nknn_fit\n\n══ Workflow [trained] ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: nearest_neighbor()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1 Recipe Step\n\n• step_normalize()\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCall:\nkknn::train.kknn(formula = ..y ~ ., data = data, ks = min_rows(5,     data, 5), kernel = ~\"rectangular\")\n\nType of response variable: nominal\nMinimal misclassification: 0.06257379\nBest kernel: rectangular\nBest k: 5\n\n\nAnd for predictions we’ll do this in two steps to get the probability, and the chosen class.\n\ner_predictions_knn &lt;- \n  predict(knn_fit, new_data = er_test_simple, type = \"class\") |&gt;\n  bind_cols(predict(knn_fit, new_data = er_test_simple, type = \"prob\")) |&gt;\n  bind_cols(er_test_simple) \n\ner_predictions_knn |&gt;\n  slice_head(n=5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  .pred_class .pred_Positive .pred_Negative ER        ESR1  TFF1\n  &lt;fct&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Positive               1              0   Positive 12.5   7.82\n2 Positive               1              0   Positive 13.3  13.8 \n3 Negative               0.2            0.8 Negative  9.26  1.97\n4 Negative               0              1   Negative  9.83  4.98\n5 Positive               1              0   Positive 14.3  14.8 \n\n\nWe can use the accuracy and specificity and sensitivity as metrics to assess the fit, but we shouldn’t be surprised to see how well it performs on all counts.\n\nclass_metrics &lt;- metric_set(accuracy, specificity, sensitivity)\n\ner_predictions_knn |&gt;\n  class_metrics(truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.944\n2 specificity binary         0.939\n3 sensitivity binary         0.945\n\n\nWe can also take a look at the probabilities.

In reality, faced with this problem there wouldn’t be much be much justification in exploring other models when simple models, that are easily explainable perform very well.\nRather than congratulating ourselves lets see how we can cope without ESR1 in our dataset, or any genes that correlate highly with it.\n\nbrca_train_tidy %&gt;% \n  select(CLEC3A:BRINP2) %&gt;% \n  cor() %&gt;% \n  data.frame() %&gt;% \n  tibble::rownames_to_column(\"Cor_with_Gene\") %&gt;% \n  select(ESR1, Cor_with_Gene) %&gt;% \n  slice_max(ESR1, n = 10) \n\n        ESR1 Cor_with_Gene\n1  1.0000000          ESR1\n2  0.8961402    AL078582.2\n3  0.8397965          AGR3\n4  0.7097549          AGR2\n5  0.6985503         GFRA1\n6  0.6948485     SERPINA11\n7  0.6874275       CYP2B7P\n8  0.6854794    AC093838.1\n9  0.6759798     LINC01087\n10 0.6756978          TFF1\n\n\nLet’s proceed by picking genes with an absolute correlation &lt; 0.7 with ESR1 as our possible predictors.\n\nkept_genes &lt;- brca_train_tidy %&gt;% \n  select(CLEC3A:BRINP2) %&gt;% \n  cor() %&gt;% \n  data.frame() %&gt;% \n  tibble::rownames_to_column(\"Cor_with_Gene\") %&gt;% \n  select(ESR1, Cor_with_Gene) %&gt;% #\n  filter(abs(ESR1) &lt;0.7) %&gt;% \n  pull(Cor_with_Gene)\n\nNow we restrict our data to just these genes, and the Estrogen Receptor status (renamed to ER for convenience).\n\ner_train &lt;- brca_train_tidy %&gt;% \n  select(all_of(kept_genes), ER = er_status_by_ihc) %&gt;% \n  mutate(ER = as.factor(ER))\n\ner_test &lt;- brca_test_tidy %&gt;% \n  select(all_of(kept_genes), ER = er_status_by_ihc) %&gt;% \n  mutate(ER = as.factor(ER))\n\n\nSetting the specification for SVM\n\nsvm_spec &lt;- \n  svm_linear(cost = 1.0) %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"classification\") %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"kernlab\") # The implementation of the SVM algorithm\n\ner_recipe_multigene &lt;- recipe(ER ~ ., data = er_train)  %&gt;% \n  step_normalize(all_predictors())\n\n\n\nFitting the SVM\n\nsvm_workflow &lt;- \n  workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(er_recipe_multigene) %&gt;%\n  add_model(svm_spec)\n\n\nsvm_fit &lt;- fit(svm_workflow, data = er_train)\n\n Setting default kernel parameters  \n\n\n\n\nSVM predictions\n\ner_predictions &lt;- \n  predict(svm_fit, new_data = er_test, type = \"class\") %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(predict(svm_fit, new_data = er_test, type = \"prob\")) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(er_test %&gt;% select(ER))\n\n\n# Calculate and print performance metrics\nsvm_metrics &lt;- metric_set(accuracy, roc_auc)\ner_predictions %&gt;%\n  svm_metrics(truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class, .pred_Positive)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy binary        0.892 \n2 roc_auc  binary        0.0840"

    "text": "Other kinds of predictor - PROOF OF CONCEPT\nSo far we have only looked at using RNA-seq expression data to classify our patients into ER status which are numeric quantities. For completeness it is worth mentioning that machine learning can use other information such as columns comprising text labels that can take a limited range of values; or in other words categorical variables (e.g. Yes/No, Grade 1, Grade 2). The methods we have seen so far as equally happy with categorical predictors as they are with numerical, or even a dataset containing a mixture of the two.\nWe will use the tumour stage, age of the patient at diagnosis, presence of progesterone receptor and ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlease just take this example as a proof of concept to show that using categorical data can be used for classification.\n\n\n\nclin_train &lt;- select(brca_train_tidy, Stage = paper_pathologic_stage, \n       Age= paper_age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis, \n       PR=pr_status_by_ihc,\n       ER=er_status_by_ihc,\n       Ethnicity=race.x) \n\nclin_test &lt;- select(brca_test_tidy, Stage = paper_pathologic_stage, \n       Age = paper_age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis, \n       PR = pr_status_by_ihc,\n       ER = er_status_by_ihc,\n       Ethnicity=race.x)\n\nAlthough KNN and SVM will work, we’ll try logistic regression and random forest as they will be a bit easier to interpret. The actual specification of the logistic regression model isn’t too different from before when we used the Lasso feature selection.\n\nlasso_spec_fixed &lt;- logistic_reg(\n  penalty = 0.01,  # Fixed penalty (lambda)\n  mixture = 1 # set alpha = 1 for lasso      \n) %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"glmnet\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"classification\")\n\nWhen dealing with our RNA-seq data we performed some filtering and normalisation outside of tidymodels to remove uninformative features. Similar steps are required with the data we are using now, and clinical variables are notorious for containing missing values and inconsistent labels (as they may have been entered manually). One way of checking our data is using the skimr package.\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nskim(clin_train)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nclin_train\n\n\nNumber of rows\n847\n\n\nNumber of columns\n5\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n4\n\n\nnumeric\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nStage\n11\n0.99\n2\n9\n0\n5\n0\n\n\nPR\n0\n1.00\n8\n15\n0\n4\n0\n\n\nER\n0\n1.00\n8\n8\n0\n2\n0\n\n\nEthnicity\n0\n1.00\n5\n32\n0\n5\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nAge\n11\n0.99\n58.53\n13.22\n26\n49\n59\n68\n90\n▁▆▇▅▂\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Age, PR and Ethnicity columns all seem to have missing values, but this doesn’t always tell the whole story as the way in which missing values are recorded can be inconsistent itself.\n\nclin_train |&gt;\n  select(-Age) |&gt;\n  purrr::map(table)\n\n$Stage\n\n       NA   Stage_I  Stage_II Stage_III  Stage_IV \n       18       132       474       198        14 \n\n$PR\n\n[Not Evaluated]   Indeterminate        Negative        Positive \n              1               3             272             571 \n\n$ER\n\nNegative Positive \n     193      654 \n\n$Ethnicity\n\namerican indian or alaska native                            asian \n                               1                               47 \n       black or african american                     not reported \n                             137                               78 \n                           white \n                             584 \n\n\nIn the PR column we have [Not Evaluated] and Indeterminate, which is effectively the same as NA, and the Ethnicity column has not reported. Also in Ethnicity we have a category with a single observation, and for the sake of practicality we will set this to NA. The Stage column has an NA string rather than R’s official NA value. skimr seemed to cope with, but to be on the safe we set it to NA.\nThere are steps we can use as part of our tidymodels recipe that will “impute” entries with missing information.\n\nclin_train &lt;- clin_train |&gt;\n  mutate(PR = ifelse(PR %in% c(\"Positive\", \"Negative\"), PR, NA)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Stage = ifelse(Stage == \"NA\", NA, Stage)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Ethnicity = ifelse(!Ethnicity %in% c(\"asian\",\"black or african american\",\"white\"), NA, Ethnicity))\n\nclin_test &lt;- clin_test |&gt;\n  mutate(PR = ifelse(PR %in% c(\"Positive\", \"Negative\"), PR, NA)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Stage = ifelse(Stage == \"NA\", NA, Stage)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Ethnicity = ifelse(!Ethnicity %in% c(\"asian\",\"black or african american\",\"white\"), NA, Ethnicity))\n\nclin_train |&gt;\n  select(-Age) |&gt;\n  mutate_all(as.factor) |&gt;\n  purrr::map(levels)\n\n$Stage\n[1] \"Stage_I\"   \"Stage_II\"  \"Stage_III\" \"Stage_IV\" \n\n$PR\n[1] \"Negative\" \"Positive\"\n\n$ER\n[1] \"Negative\" \"Positive\"\n\n$Ethnicity\n[1] \"asian\"                     \"black or african american\"\n[3] \"white\"                    \n\nclin_test |&gt;\n  select(-Age) |&gt;\n  mutate_all(as.factor) |&gt;\n  purrr::map(levels)\n\n$Stage\n[1] \"Stage_I\"   \"Stage_II\"  \"Stage_III\" \"Stage_IV\" \n\n$PR\n[1] \"Negative\" \"Positive\"\n\n$ER\n[1] \"Negative\" \"Positive\"\n\n$Ethnicity\n[1] \"asian\"                     \"black or african american\"\n[3] \"white\"                    \n\n\ntidymodels has a variety of methods for imputing (or if you like make an educated guess at) the missing values. For numeric variables such as Age we can simply replace with the average (median in this case). Similarly, missing categorical variables can be replaced with the most common, or mode, value. I’m happy to replace Stage and ER in this way as there were not too many missing values, but Ethnicity had rather a lot more. Instead, we can add a step to include an “unknown”. This gives the model gives the model the ability to test the importance of the “missingness”, which would be useful if the values were not missing at random.\nIf we keep Age as a numeric value the model will try and assess the impact of each increasing year on the ER status, which is probably not what we want. Instead, we can categorise the Age into four equal groups.\nFinally, the most important step is to add what are called “dummy” variables to the data. This called One Hot Encoding and is required because methods like logistic regression can’t actually work directly on categorical data and require numbers. To turn a categorical variable such as PR into numeric data it can create two new columns (PR_Positive and PR_Negative) which contain either 0 or 1 depending on whether a particular row is Positive or Negative not. i.e. if an observation is originally Positive it will have a 1 in the PR_Positive column and a 0 in PR_Negative. Using the all_nominal_predictors function this transformation is applied to all our columns.\n\nclin_recipe &lt;- recipe(ER ~ ., data = clin_train) |&gt;\n  step_impute_median(Age) |&gt;\n  step_impute_mode(Stage) |&gt;\n  step_impute_mode(PR) |&gt;\n  step_unknown(Ethnicity) |&gt;\n  step_discretize(Age, options = list(cuts = 4)) |&gt;\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())\n\nIf we want to see the effect of these transformation we run a two-step process of prep followed by bake. prep() estimates or trains the recipe steps. For example, it calculates the median of Age, the mode of Stage, the cutoff points for the four Age bins, and the complete dictionary (schema) for the dummy variables. bake() then applies the rules to a data set. That is, it takes the clin_train data, and performs the steps of the recipe.\n\nclin_recipe |&gt;\n  prep(training = clin_train) |&gt;\n  bake(new_data = clin_train) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 11\n   ER       Stage_Stage_II Stage_Stage_III Stage_Stage_IV Age_bin2 Age_bin3\n   &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Negative              1               0              0        0        0\n 2 Negative              0               1              0        1        0\n 3 Negative              0               1              0        0        1\n 4 Negative              0               1              0        0        1\n 5 Negative              1               0              0        0        0\n 6 Negative              1               0              0        0        0\n 7 Negative              1               0              0        1        0\n 8 Negative              0               0              0        0        0\n 9 Negative              1               0              0        0        0\n10 Negative              1               0              0        0        0\n# ℹ 5 more variables: Age_bin4 &lt;dbl&gt;, PR_Positive &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Ethnicity_black.or.african.american &lt;dbl&gt;, Ethnicity_white &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Ethnicity_unknown &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nWith everything in place, we can now fit the model and look at the resulting coefficients.\n\nclin_workflow &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_model(lasso_spec_fixed) %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(clin_recipe)\n\n# Fit the model directly to your training data\nclin_lasso_fit &lt;- clin_workflow %&gt;%\n  fit(data = clin_train)\n\ntidy(clin_lasso_fit) |&gt; \n  filter(term != \"(Intercept)\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(abs(estimate)))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   term                                estimate penalty\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 PR_Positive                           3.86      0.01\n 2 Stage_Stage_IV                        0.897     0.01\n 3 Ethnicity_black.or.african.american  -0.322     0.01\n 4 Age_bin4                              0.275     0.01\n 5 Stage_Stage_II                       -0.0928    0.01\n 6 Stage_Stage_III                       0         0.01\n 7 Age_bin2                              0         0.01\n 8 Age_bin3                              0         0.01\n 9 Ethnicity_white                       0         0.01\n10 Ethnicity_unknown                     0         0.01\n\n\nThe results strongly suggest that being PR Positive is hugely associated with the ER Positive outcome, with being Stage IV is associated with ER Positive outcome (but less strongly so). On the other hand, an ethnicity of black of african american is associated with a lower log-odds or being ER Positive. Age is also weakly positive with being in the oldest age bin (vs. the youngest reference bin) slightly increases the probability of being ER Positive. I think these all make sense although the question itself is perhaps not of primary biological interest. Finally, lets see what the metrics look like:-\n\nclass_metrics &lt;- metric_set(accuracy, specificity, sensitivity)\n\nclin_lasso_fit |&gt;\n  predict(new_data = clin_test) |&gt;\n  bind_cols(clin_test) |&gt;\n  mutate(ER = as.factor(ER)) |&gt;\n  class_metrics(truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.831\n2 specificity binary         0.817\n3 sensitivity binary         0.878\n\n\nThey are actually not that bad. It shows high Accuracy with the overall rate of correct predictions and well-balanced with the Sensitivity (\\(\\mathbf{87.8\\%}\\)) and Specificity (\\(\\mathbf{81.7\\%}\\)) close to each other. This means the model is not cheating by always predicting one class. The slight edge in sensitivity means the model is slightly better at correctly identifying the Positive cases. Depending on the clinical goal, this is often desirable (i.e., prioritizing “catching” the ER Positive tumors).\nFor good measure, let’s try and random forest which we learnt about in Part 3a of this series.\n\nrandom_forest_spec &lt;- rand_forest(\n    mode = \"classification\", \n    trees = 1000 # Using 1000 trees for robustness\n  ) %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"ranger\", importance = \"permutation\")\n\n\nset.seed(42)\n\n\nrandom_forest_workflow &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_model(random_forest_spec) %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(clin_recipe)\n\nrandom_forest_fit &lt;- random_forest_workflow %&gt;%\n  fit(data = clin_train)\n\nrandom_forest_fit\n\n══ Workflow [trained] ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: rand_forest()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6 Recipe Steps\n\n• step_impute_median()\n• step_impute_mode()\n• step_impute_mode()\n• step_unknown()\n• step_discretize()\n• step_dummy()\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRanger result\n\nCall:\n ranger::ranger(x = maybe_data_frame(x), y = y, num.trees = ~1000,      importance = ~\"permutation\", num.threads = 1, verbose = FALSE,      seed = sample.int(10^5, 1), probability = TRUE) \n\nType:                             Probability estimation \nNumber of trees:                  1000 \nSample size:                      847 \nNumber of independent variables:  10 \nMtry:                             3 \nTarget node size:                 10 \nVariable importance mode:         permutation \nSplitrule:                        gini \nOOB prediction error (Brier s.):  0.0916587 \n\nrandom_forest_fit |&gt;\n  predict(new_data = clin_test) |&gt;\n  bind_cols(clin_test) |&gt;\n    mutate(ER = as.factor(ER)) |&gt;\n  class_metrics(truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.845\n2 specificity binary         0.854\n3 sensitivity binary         0.816\n\nimportance_df &lt;- pull_workflow_fit(random_forest_fit)$fit$variable.importance %&gt;%\n  enframe(name = \"term\", value = \"Importance\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Importance))\nimportance_df\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   term                                Importance\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 PR_Positive                           0.139   \n 2 Ethnicity_white                       0.00342 \n 3 Ethnicity_black.or.african.american   0.00329 \n 4 Age_bin4                              0.00222 \n 5 Age_bin3                              0.00203 \n 6 Ethnicity_unknown                     0.00145 \n 7 Stage_Stage_IV                        0.00122 \n 8 Stage_Stage_III                       0.00111 \n 9 Stage_Stage_II                       -0.000108\n10 Age_bin2                             -0.000160\n\n\nThe metrics look to be slightly better than the Lasso, and being Positive for PR comes out as the top predictor again."

This maximum distance is known as the margin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analogy for SVM\n\n\n\nA popular analogy for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is that of a construction company trying to construct a road between two groups of data (in this case, our Positive and Negative samples). The centre line of the road is the SVM’s Decision Boundary; the place where the classification switches from one class to the other. The surrounding land defined by the widest possible empty gap is the margin. The primary goal of the SVM is to maximize this margin (the width of the road’s shoulders). The data points that sit exactly on the edge of this maximum margin are called the “Support Vectors”, because they are the only points that define and “support” the position of the boundary.\n\n\n\nSetting the specification for SVM\nIf all that sounds a bit abstract, thankfully it is fairly straightforward to implement in tidymodels. Since our classification task is quite straightforward due to the features we have chosen, a linear boundary should work. This is specified using svm_linear. Other more complex and non-linear alternatives are availble. Like some of the other models we have seen there are some hyperparameters that can either be supplied as arguments to svm_linear and / or be decided by tuning. For now we will accept the defaults.\n\nsvm_spec_fixed &lt;- svm_linear() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"classification\") %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"kernlab\")\n\nWe can now fit the model and re-use the same recipe from above that will scale our features.\n\nsvm_workflow &lt;- \n  workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(er_recipe_simple) %&gt;%\n  add_model(svm_spec_fixed)\n\n\nsvm_fit &lt;- fit(svm_workflow, data = er_train_simple)\n\n Setting default kernel parameters  \n\nsvm_fit\n\n══ Workflow [trained] ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: svm_linear()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1 Recipe Step\n\n• step_normalize()\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSupport Vector Machine object of class \"ksvm\" \n\nSV type: C-svc  (classification) \n parameter : cost C = 1 \n\nLinear (vanilla) kernel function. \n\nNumber of Support Vectors : 132 \n\nObjective Function Value : -129.3322 \nTraining error : 0.053129 \nProbability model included. \n\n\nBefore we do any predictions on our test data we can see the boundary in action by first creating a large grid of theoretical values from our dataset. We can then predict the probability of belonging to either the class (Positive or Negative) for each point in the grid according to the model, and plot using a geom_tile in ggplot2. This should show the approximate location of the boundary.\n\ngrid &lt;- expand.grid(\n  ESR1 = seq(min(er_train_simple$ESR1) - 0.5, max(er_train_simple$ESR1) + 0.5, length.out = 100),\n  TFF1 = seq(min(er_train_simple$TFF1) - 0.5, max(er_train_simple$TFF1) + 0.5, length.out = 100)\n)\n\n# Predict class probabilities for the grid\ngrid&lt;- mutate(grid, prob = predict(svm_fit, new_data = grid, type = \"prob\")$.pred_Positive)\n\n# Plot decision boundary + training points\nggplot() +\n  geom_tile(data = grid, aes(x = ESR1, y = TFF1, fill = prob), alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_point(data = er_train_simple, aes(x = ESR1, y = TFF1, color = ER), size = 2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    low = \"salmon\",        # Color for 0% chance (Negative)\n    mid = \"white\",            # Color for 50% chance (Boundary)\n    high = \"steelblue\",       # Color for 100% chance (Positive)\n    midpoint = 0.5,           # Center of the scale\n    limits = c(0, 1)          # Ensure the scale runs from 0 to 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Positive\" = \"blue\", \"Negative\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(title = \"SVM Decision Boundary For Estrogen Receptor (ER) classification\",\n       fill = \"Predicted Class\", color = \"Actual Class\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, for completeness we make predictions on the testing data although shouldn’t be too surprised by the performance.\n\ner_predictions_svm &lt;- \n  predict(svm_fit, new_data = er_test_simple, type = \"class\") %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(predict(svm_fit, new_data = er_test_simple, type = \"prob\")) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(er_test_simple %&gt;% select(ER))\n\nclass_metrics(er_predictions_svm, truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.944\n2 specificity binary         0.959\n3 sensitivity binary         0.939\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn aside - other types of SVM\n\n\n\nSVM can be applied to other classification problems where data cannot be easily separated in a linear (i.e. by a straight line).

    "text": "Summary\nWe have now added KNN and SVM to our machine learning toolkit. Whilst we used simpler data (as seen in Part 2) to illustrate the methods, they could be applied seamlessly to datasets with many more features such as the data discussed in Part 3a. Furthermore, we saw that our models can also be applied to categorical data if the need arises. This required critical pre-processing steps like One-Hot Encoding (step_dummy()) and careful handling of missing data; even using techniques like step_unknown() to test the predictive power of missingness itself.\nWhilst our models are working well, we have often relied on arbitrary decisions about some “hyper-parameters” such as the number of trees comprising the random forest or the degree of shrinkage in glmnet. In the next part, we will move past these manual choices and see how to systematically tune our models to find the optimal settings, ensuring the highest possible performance and generalization to new, unseen data."

What we do instead is try and explore the full range of values, and find roughly the region where the optimal values are located. In practical terms this is often perfectly adequate.\nInfrastructure for tuning parameters is support by dials and tune which are both part of the tidymodels eco-system. i.e. they get installed and loaded when you install and load tidymodels.\n\nhttps://dials.tidymodels.org/\nhttps://tune.tidymodels.org/\n\nThere are a couple of convenient helper functions penalty and mixture that will create templates for choosing values for tuning. We then have to create a grid of values that we want to test. This is simply a data frame (/tibble) containing combinations of penalty and mixture and can be created with the grid_regular function. This function will ensure that the full range of values is tested. In other words that the maximum and minimum values are included in the search. With the levels argument we can control how finely we split the ranges.\nAnother option is to use grid_random to create a random set of combinations of the parameters. Instead of levels we say how many combinations we want in total using size.\n\npenalty_range &lt;- penalty(range = c(-5, 0)) # use helper function to define range of penalty values\nmixture_range &lt;- mixture() # use helper function to define a range of mixture values\n\nelastic_net_grid_regular &lt;- grid_regular(\n  penalty_range, \n  mixture_range,\n  levels = c(penalty = 5, mixture = 3) # Test 5 penalty values x 3 mixture values = 15 combinations\n)\n\nelastic_net_grid_random &lt;- grid_random(\n  penalty_range, \n  mixture_range,\n  size = 15\n)\n\nWith the setup we have just created there are 15 different models to be fit (one model for each combination in our grid), and the 10-fold strategy we defined with vfolds_cv means we have to fit each of these 15 models 10 times. In total we have 150 models, and for each we want to assess the performance. This is quite a lot of work! Fortunately we can do this quite efficiently with tidymodels and get an output that we can assess. The tune_grid function will use the cross-validation strategy defined with vfolds_cv, a grid structure and compute performance metrics for your workflow."

Fortunately, I have Dr. Lewis Quayle to thank for some code on his post on tidymodels to configure tidymodels to use multiple CPU cores on your computer where available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe can run the code in parallel because the tuning process is inherently an example of what was called “embarrassingly parallel” back in the day (people sometimes prefer “Pleasingly parallel” nowadays). In other words, the training / testing occurring at each fold in our workflow is completely independant and can therefore be run at the same time if possible rather than waiting for the previous fold to finish.\n\n\n\n## setting a seed required for reproducibility\nset.seed(42)\n\n# register a parallel back-end\nfuture::plan(future::multisession(), workers = parallel::detectCores() - 1)\n\n\nrf_tune_res &lt;- tune_grid(\n  rf_workflow, \n  resamples = er_folds, \n  grid = rf_grid,\n  metrics = metric_set(accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, roc_auc)\n)\n\nAs before, we can plot to get a quick overview.\n\nrf_tune_res %&gt;% autoplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot chooses informative labels where “Minimal Node Size” = min_n and “# Randomly Selected Predictors” = mtry. If we wish to focus on Area Under the Curve (roc_auc) the best combination looks to be lower min_n and mtry.\n\nshow_best(elastic_net_tune_res, metric = \"roc_auc\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 8\n   penalty mixture .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err .config              \n     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                \n1 0.0562         0 roc_auc binary     0.959    10 0.0103  Preprocessor1_Model04\n2 1              0 roc_auc binary     0.958    10 0.00964 Preprocessor1_Model05\n3 0.00001        0 roc_auc binary     0.956    10 0.0107  Preprocessor1_Model01\n4 0.000178       0 roc_auc binary     0.956    10 0.0107  Preprocessor1_Model02\n5 0.00316        0 roc_auc binary     0.956    10 0.0107  Preprocessor1_Model03\n\nbest_params &lt;- select_best(rf_tune_res, metric = \"roc_auc\")\n\nAnd now we can create the final model and check the importance of the features\n\nrf_final_workflow &lt;- rf_workflow %&gt;% \n  finalize_workflow(best_params)\n\n\nrf_final_fit &lt;- rf_final_workflow %&gt;% \n  fit(er_train)\n\nimportance_df &lt;- pull_workflow_fit(rf_final_fit)$fit$variable.importance %&gt;%\n  enframe(name = \"term\", value = \"Importance\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Importance))\n\nand we can make a simple bar plot if we wish\n\nimportance_df %&gt;% \n  ## pick the top 20 \n  slice_max(Importance, n = 20) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Importance, y = forcats::fct_reorder(term, Importance))) + geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + ylab(\"Gene\") + xlab(\"Importance\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand the final predictions and evaluation follow a pattern that is hopefully familiar by now\n\nrf_final_fit %&gt;% \n  predict(new_data =  er_test) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols(select(er_test, ER)) %&gt;% \n  class_metrics(truth = ER, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.925\n2 sensitivity binary         0.898\n3 specificity binary         0.933"

    "text": "Summary\nThis concludes the end of this little series on using tidymodels for classification of omics data. I hope that I have covered the main principles of the tidymodels eco-system. Just looking through the code I can see a lot of places where the code is reused, which is good for readability and extendability. Even though I have not covered all the possible classification methods, it should be possible with relative ease (that is relative to coding everything from scratch) to translate what we have covered here to other methods. This is real advantage of tidymodels in that most of our time should be spent interpreting and refining that having to code everything by-hand. I haven’t even covered the use of regression vs classification (that is, predicting a numeric rather than categorical outcome) and again this should be within your reach now by using set_mode(\"regression\") instead of classification in the models covered here.\nOf course it would be remiss of me not to mention AI and deep learning methods that are increasingly being used in research. Whilst these are more complex methods, the core principles of training / testing and tuning are still highly applicable. Furthermore, these methods are still completely dependant on having appropriately filtered and cleaned data as a starting point. Although Python is probably the market leader for AI, R actually has interfaces to keras and tensorflow (two of the most popular implementations). There is no need to abandon R just yet."
