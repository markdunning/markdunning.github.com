    "text": "I’m a Bioinformatician with a background in Mathematics and Computer Science with over 20 years of experience. I specialise in the visualisation and interpretation of complex data and have a wealth of experience in making results accessible and easy to interrogate for wet-lab biologists. I also have a track-record in developing and delivering training courses and workships, along with formal teaching.\nI obtained my PhD in the Statistics and Computational Biology group of Simon Tavare at the University of Cambridge. During this time, I developed the beadarray Bioconductor package for the analysis of Illumina microarray data. My PhD thesis is available online, should you be interested.\nAfter my PhD, I worked as a Bioinformatics Analyst within the Bioinformatics Core; consulting on, and assisting in, the analysis on all types of high-throughput datasets. During this time I worked on studies to define subtypes of Breast and Prostate cancer and established pipelines for analysis whole-genome and exome resequencing data.\nI held the role of “Bioinformatics Training Coordinator” in the Bioinformatics Core of Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute. I organised, developed and facilitated Bioinformatics training courses to teach computational and analytical skills to wet-lab biologists.\nFrom October 2017 I established the Bioinformatics Core at The University of Sheffield which ran until August 2025. Along with supporting clinicians and researchers across campus, I also contributed to various MSC and undergraduate programs as well as obtaining training / teaching qualifications from thecarpentries and AdvanceHE (FHEA)"
