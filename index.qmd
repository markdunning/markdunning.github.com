I'm a Bioinformatician with a background in Mathematics and Computer Science with over 20 years of experience. I specialise in the visualisation and interpretation of complex data and have a wealth of experience in making results accessible and easy to interrogate for wet-lab biologists. I also have a track-record in developing and delivering training courses and workships, along with formal teaching.

I obtained my PhD in the Statistics and Computational Biology group of [Simon Tavare](http://www.compbio.group.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. During this time, I developed the [beadarray](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/beadarray.html) Bioconductor package for the analysis of Illumina microarray data. My PhD thesis is available [online](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/218542), should you be interested.

After my PhD, I worked as a Bioinformatics Analyst within the Bioinformatics Core; consulting on, and assisting in, the analysis on all types of high-throughput datasets. During this time I worked on studies to define subtypes of [Breast](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7403/full/nature10983.html) and [Prostate](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396415300712) cancer and established pipelines for analysis whole-genome and exome resequencing data.

I held the role of "*Bioinformatics Training Coordinator*" in the Bioinformatics Core of [Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute](http://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/). I organised, developed and facilitated [Bioinformatics training courses](http://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/core-facilities/bioinformatics-core/training) to teach computational and analytical skills to wet-lab biologists. 

From October 2017 I established the [Bioinformatics Core at The University of Sheffield](https://sbc.shef.ac.uk) which ran until August 2025. Along with supporting clinicians and researchers across campus, I also contributed to various MSC and undergraduate programs as well as obtaining training / teaching qualifications from [thecarpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and [AdvanceHE](https://advance-he.ac.uk/) (FHEA)
