# Disclaimer

::: warning
Although R is well-regarded as a tool for performing statistical analysis, this workshop will not explicitly teach stats. Instead we give introduce the tools that we allow you to manipulate and interrogate your data into a form with which you can execute statistical tests.

# Setup

If you are following these notes independently (outside one of our workshops)

From the RStudio menus, Choose the **File** -\> **New Project** option and select New Directory from the new window

![](/files/training/r/new_proj1.png)

Then for the **Project Type** pick New Project.

![](/files/training/r/new_proj2.png)

It will ask you to pick a new Directory name, and where to create that directory (e.g. your Home directory or directory where you usually save your work)

![](/files/training/r/new_proj3.png)

RStudio should now refresh itself. You can now download the data required for the workshop by copying and pasting the following into the R console (as shown in the screenshot)

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://github.com/sheffield-bioinformatics-core/r-online/raw/master/CourseData.zip", destfile = "CourseData.zip")
```

![](/files/training/r/data_download.png) The files from the zip file can be extracted using the command:-

```{r eval=FALSE}
unzip("CourseData.zip")
```

Your RStudio screen should look like:-

![](/files/training/r/data_download_2.png)

You will need to install some R packages and download some data before you start. You can install the packages by copying and pasting the following into an R console and pressing ENTER

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("tidyr")
```

You can check that this worked by copying and pasting the following:-

```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheffield-bioinformatics-core/r-online/master/check_packages.R")
```
